# Update 2024-11

## Project progress

The initial 16 projects have been contacted with "can we help with your security" - with already
some feedback and meetings with the maintainers scheduled in December. We have also prepared ideas and
subjects for a series of blog posts that we are going to write summarising our findings.

We also prepared two submission for FOSDEM and FOSS Backstage conferences in 2025 - talking about the
project. We are waiting for results of the CFPs.

Not much progress on tooling yet, we continue to look for other candidates in the Apache Software Foundation
and as discussions on the "tooling" position is still ongoing.

Jarek has been invited by the ASF infrastructure team to be a part of the interviewing team for the tooling
position in the Apache Software Foundation.

As part of the engagement work is on-going on implementing and testing Trusted Publishing workflow that will
be reusable for the Apache Software Foundation projects. The discussion on how to do it happened in the
ASF infrastructure team and the implementation is
[in progress](https://github.com/gopidesupavan/gh-svn-pypi-publisher/pull/1)

## Open Refactory bug analysis

Further refinement of the graphs have been prepared. A presentation of the current state of the project
has been presented by the Open Refactory team - stressing the multiple "F" that their tooling might help with.

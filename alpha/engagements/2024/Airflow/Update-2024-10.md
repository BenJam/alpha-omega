# Update 2024-10

## Project progress

There was [Community Over Code](https://communityovercode.com/) - 7-19 October, Denver, where security united project was presented 
in a talk and Birds of Feather session. The Birds of Feather session was well attended (including
Board Members of the Apache Software Foundation and infrastructure folks) and we 
got some good feedback from the community.

Airflow is undergoing a major release work Airflow 3 and that includes a lot of decisions and discussions
on dependencies - for example we decided to get rid of a venerable `connexion` library and replace it with
`FastAPI` - which is a more modern and maintained library and it reshapes the dependency graph of Airflow
(removes some candidates for deeper analysis and adds some more). There are also discussion on how to
split Airflow into independent packages, with subset of dependencies for separate providers - that might
change the ways we approach dependencies.

Discussions were started with Apache Software Foundation on funding the new "tooling" position for the ASF
- and also resulting from that the search for another candidate for the position was started.

## Open Refactory bug analysis

CVE charts produced by Open Refactory have been largely improved and we are looking for making then a good
input for our discussions with maintainers.

## Project progress

We have feedback from more than half projects contacted, communicated with them and received feedback on the
proposed actions.

We prepared a yearly report and sent it - summarising hte whole 5 months of work.

The talk for FOSDEM and FOSS Backstage conferences in 2025 have been accepted. Prepared submission for VulnCon
and PyCon US to talk about the progress.

Jarek took part in review round for the new tooling team members for the ASF and the interviews concluded
with selecting the candidates that start to work for the AFS soon

We completed development of Trusted Publishing workflow that will be reusable for the Apache Software
Foundation projects. We are waiting for infrastructure changes to deploy it in the ASF:

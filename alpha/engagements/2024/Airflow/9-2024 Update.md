# Update 2024-08

## Project progress

The project progressed a bit slower with improving tooling and engagement with
the dependencies as we mostly focused on enhancing our initial data, figuring out
the best way of communication and also raising awareness of the project and gathering
feedback from wider community - both in the Apache Airflow community and the
Apache Software Foundation and security community.

There were two events that the project was presented at or prepared to be presented:

* [Airflow Summit](https://airflowsummit.org/) 10-12 September, San Francisco - where the project was presented in the keynote
* [Community Over Code](https://communityovercode.com/) - 7-19 October, Denver, planned talk and Birds of Feather session

Jarek who mostly drives the project has been on vacations for 2 weeks in US between those two events
So not much progress was made in other areas. Also Jarek waited for recording from 
the Keynote of the Airflow Summit to be able to share it with the maintainers of
dependencies to be contacted.

The Keynote Recording is now available: 
[Security United: collaborative effort on securing Airflow ecosystem with Alpha-Omega, PSF & ASF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6gfoVJXWEE)

We already addressed some of the projects with `Forego` assessment: `unicodecsv has been removed from
Airflow dependencies as it has been identified as stale and easily replaceable.

## Open Refactory bug analysis

We progressed on preparing CVE charts that will show health of the progress, initial
reports have been shown at the Keynote and they are being perfected and improved and
we plan to have good results in October.

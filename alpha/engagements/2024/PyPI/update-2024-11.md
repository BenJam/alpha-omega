# PyPI Package Lifecycle Engineering: November 2024

## Completed

* Performed a full documentation migration for all of PyPI's public APIs, feeds,
  datasets, etc., as scoped in [#16541]. All public user-facing documentation
  for PyPI's APIs now lives under <https://docs.pypi.org/api/>.
* Completed initial development of the "archived" marker feature as
  [#17005]; now in final review.

## In progress

* Continued scoping/decomposing [PEP 694] for upload API modernization;
  currently investigating draft support.
* Began development on subsequent "status markers" besides "archived,"
  continuing with a design phase for a "deprecated" marker.

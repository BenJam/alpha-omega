# Alpha Engagement: PyPI Package Lifecycle Engineering

The purpose of this Alpha engagement is to fund the development
of fixes and enhancements to the Python packaging ecosystem's
project "lifecycle," with particular focus on:

1. Improving the reliability of index retrieval by driving the
   ecosystem towards a soft removal model ("yanking") instead of hard
   deletion;
2. Improving project status reporting abilities, including giving
   Python project maintainers the ability to emit structured metadata
   on PyPI regarding a project's status (e.g. "finished", "archived",
   "deprecated", etc.);
3. Adding support for project drafting and bulk uploads (i.e. multi-file
   uploads) to PyPI, via an implementation of [PEP 694].

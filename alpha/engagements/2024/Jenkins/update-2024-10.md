##### jQuery upgrade
jquery plugin  deprecation on the radar because lots of installs
getting down the road to get it csp compliant
Collapsing console is using it, and they worked on the jquery 1.0 itself uses eval itself, so it's a bit of a mess.
jquery 1.x can't support CSP, so...
this won't work at all
anything that uses 1.x should be first updated to 3.x
and then we'll work on it, but it might not be enough
builkd pipeline plugin was updated by basil, but that was not enough, but still using jquery 2.3.x
Going from 1 to 3 on the build pipeline plugin made it work better, but did not solve all the problem.
We then have to modernize the plugins before going to jsquery 3.x.

calendar-view plugin was migrated by basil to jquery 3.x,.

console navigation: dead, let's abandon it. It's not worth the effort.
delivery pipeline plugin, last release 7 months ago, so we'll keep it as is for now.
environment dashboard plugin, too old and clunky
list git branches parameter plugin, it still has an active maintainer, so, let's keep it.

maven cascade: 12 years ago, let's forget about it.
stf: no way
restricted register: forget it


send stacktrace plugin: too old and unmaintained

ui test capture: too old and unmaintained

xray connector: last commit two years ago, not at this stage, or save it but at lowest priority

jquery ui, deprecated, then leave it as is

#### CSP Scan from Daniel
csp scanner from daniel beck, which is not ready yet

https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-60865?jql=text%20~%20%22csp%22

basil will launch the test when it's ready
it does catch quite a few problems now, the eval, the select, and so on.

Basil will run the tool on the whole ecosystem, and then automate the creation of JIRA tickets for the issues found.

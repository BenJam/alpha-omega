### Progress Summary
#### Completed Tasks
1. Shlomo has already [shipped one CSP fix](https://github.com/jenkinsci/junit-plugin/pull/654) in the JUnit plugin, proposed [another PR](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-job-plugin/pull/477) that Basil is testing for the Workflow Job, and is in the process of developing/testing a fix for the [Subversion Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/subversion-plugin/pulls).
2. One important core CSP problem fixed by Daniel Beck that was developed over a year ago, has been updated, reviewed, and merged.
4. Released CSP fixtures that had been sitting around, like the [matrix project](https://github.com/jenkinsci/matrix-project-plugin/releases/tag/838.v4d7b_7b_f9b_d4b_), and [credentials](https://github.com/jenkinsci/credentials-plugin/releases/tag/1380.va_435002fa_924). It took some work to retest them and get them released.

12. ATH has gone from a very low pass-rate to something very high in one week. CSP in report only mode 62 failures out of 370 tests which makes 81%. Ath is a low-hanging fruit, but it is the first milestone to reach

#### jQuery Plugin Deprecation Analysis

###### Overview
jQuery plugin deprecation is a significant concern due to high installation numbers and Content Security Policy (CSP) compliance requirements.

###### Current Status Analysis

###### High Priority - Active Projects
1. **Collapsing Console**
- Currently using jQuery 1.0
- Uses eval() function
- Requires significant updates for CSP compliance

2. **Build Pipeline Plugin**
- Updated by Basil to jQuery 2.3.x
- Partial improvement after upgrading to jQuery 3.x
- Still requires additional modernization

3. **List Git Branches Parameter Plugin**
- Has active maintainer
- Recommended for continued maintenance

###### Recently Updated
- **Calendar View Plugin**
- Successfully migrated to jQuery 3.x by Basil

##### Moderate Priority
- **Delivery Pipeline Plugin**
- Last release: 7 months ago
- Current status maintained for now

###### Low Priority/Abandon Candidates
1. **Console Navigation**
- Recommended for abandonment
- Effort-to-value ratio unfavorable

2. **Environment Dashboard Plugin**
- Too outdated
- Complex architecture

3. **XRay Connector**
- Last commit: 2 years ago
- Consider for lowest priority maintenance

###### Recommended for Abandonment
1. Old/Unmaintained Plugins:
- Maven Cascade (12 years old)
- STF
- Restricted Register
- Send Stacktrace Plugin
- UI Test Capture

###### Migration Strategy
1. Update plugins from jQuery 1.x to 3.x
2. Modernize plugin architecture
3. Implement CSP compliance measures

###### jQuery UI Status
- Currently deprecated
- Recommendation: maintain current state without updates

###### Next Steps
1. Prioritize updates for actively maintained plugins
2. Document abandonment process for deprecated plugins
3. Create migration guidelines for jQuery 3.x updates
4. Develop CSP compliance checklist

#### CSP Scanner Project Update

##### Current Status
- CSP Scanner tool under development by Daniel Beck
- Not yet ready for production use
- Reference: [JENKINS-60865](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-60865?jql=text%20~%20%22csp%22)

##### Capabilities
The scanner currently detects several security issues, including:
- eval() function usage
- select statements
- Other CSP-related vulnerabilities

##### Planned Implementation
Basil will:
1. Execute initial testing when the tool is ready
2. Run comprehensive scans across the Jenkins ecosystem
3. Implement automated JIRA ticket creation for identified issues

##### Next Steps
1. Complete tool development
2. Conduct initial testing phase
3. Deploy ecosystem-wide scanning
4. Begin automated issue tracking
5. Monitor and address discovered vulnerabilities

We will provide updates as this security initiative progresses.

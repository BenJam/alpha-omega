### Progress Summary
#### Completed Tasks
1. Shlomo has already [shipped one CSP fix](https://github.com/jenkinsci/junit-plugin/pull/654) in the JUnit plugin, proposed [another PR](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-job-plugin/pull/477) that Basil is testing for the Workflow Job, and is in the process of developing/testing a fix for the [Subversion Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/subversion-plugin/pulls).
2. One important core CSP problem fixed by Daniel Beck that was developed over a year ago, has been updated, reviewed, and merged.

It took some work to retest them and get them released.

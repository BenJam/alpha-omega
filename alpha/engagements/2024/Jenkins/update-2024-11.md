# Report Date: Nov 04, 2024
## Current Status
### Progress Summary
#### Build Pipeline Plugin
Shlomo is tackling the complex Build Pipeline plugin, which involves a series of interdependent changes. To ensure stability, he plans to consolidate 7-8 pull requests into a single, comprehensive PR for testing. This approach aims to prevent system breakage that could occur if changes were merged individually. Alternatively, the team might merge the PRs one by one and conduct a thorough test afterward.

#### HTML Publisher and Subversion Plugins
The HTML Publisher plugin has several open PRs, and the Subversion plugin is also actively being worked on. The Publish Over SSH plugin has been merged but is pending release, while the Git Parameters plugin has already been released.

#### Progress Metrics
The team has processed plugins in the 40k installation range, with 60k already completed. The next target is plugins with 22k installations. The Prism API plugin is also in focus, with Basil coordinating with Ulli for PR merges.

#### Active Choices Plugin
Yaroslav has made significant progress on the Active Choices plugin, with a responsive maintainer facilitating the updates. Selenium tests have proven invaluable, catching browser-specific issues that the Acceptance Test Harness (ATH) might miss.

#### SSH and Active Directory Plugins
The SSH plugin has several PRs awaiting review, similar to the Active Directory plugin. These reviews are crucial for the next steps.

#### Future Targets
The Build Pipeline plugin remains a major focus due to its complexity and interdependencies, closely linked with the Delivery Pipeline plugin. Both plugins share similar themes and purposes, making them candidates for similar modernization efforts.

#### Challenging Plugins
The Sonar plugin, managed outside the organization with its own CI, presents unique challenges. The Blue Ocean plugin is temporarily on hold due to testing and building difficulties, and the Artifactory plugin is particularly challenging due to its local installation requirements and maintenance status.

#### Upcoming Updates
IVY and CVS plugins, despite being somewhat obsolete, are still in use and are next in line for updates. The Build Timestamp and Build Monitor plugins are also on the radar, with the latter in good shape for modernization.

#### Automation and Modernization
Automation of the modernization process is expected to be beneficial, especially for older plugins like the Dynamic Extended Choice Parameter plugin. The team is also considering modernizing the GitLab Logo plugin, which is still based on an older Jenkins version.

## Current Status
### Progress Summary
#### CSP Header Implementation
Adding CSP headers will require the use of server filters in Jenkins core to add the necessary headers. This task is deferred until the current list of plugins is addressed.

#### Plugin Updates
- **HTML Publisher**: Despite initial difficulties, the plugin now works and has been released.
- **Publish Over SSH**: Progress is slow due to an unenthusiastic maintainer.
- **Blue Ocean**: On hold due to testing and building difficulties; soon to be deprecated.
- **Sonar Scanner Jenkins**: Merged today.
- **Active Choices**: Progressing slowly as the maintainer requests more unit tests.
- **Warnings NG**: Focused on deleting dead code.
- **Build Pipeline**: Requires more work and is the biggest ongoing task.

#### Targeting Plugins
The team is targeting plugins with 10k installations:
- **Embeddable Build Status**: No longer deprecated.
- **Global Build Stats**: Incomplete but requires minor work.
- **Dockerhub Notification**: Released today.
- **Azure Storage**: Fixed but needs more work.
- **Test Result Reporter**: Near completion.
- **Google Compute Engine**: Completed.
- **Custom Folder Icon**: Completed.

#### Important Plugins
- **Dependency Check**: Still important and actively maintained by Nick Falco.
- **M2Release**: Latest PRs were modernization, but nothing major.
- **Test Results Analyser**: Uncertain importance, worked on by Martin Pokorny.
- **Plugin Usage**: CSP work is ongoing.
- **Robot**: Uncertain status, but CSP work is happening.
- **Delivery Pipeline**: A significant task ahead.
- **Claim**: Still in use.
- **OWASP Dependency Track**: Still in use.
- **View and Parameter Plugins**: Focused on even with low installation numbers.

#### Dead Plugins
- **Port Allocator**: No longer maintained.

# Report Date: Nov 26, 2024
## Current Status
some plugins generate html thanks to javascript, and use onclick. These haven't been found by the csp scanner yet
jensec now knows about it, but they won't have time to fix for the time being. We'll have to fix it by ourselves
Basil thinks it's pretty rare though. Maybe we'll also find onBlur, onChange.

 The delivery pipeline plugin may have some of these onClick generated within Javascript.
The vmanager plugin too: https://github.com/jenkinsci/vmanager-plugin/blob/b90087f1c0ed84ce8fb056715a897b6fe69db3fb/src/main/webapp/js/vmanager_report.js#L12732  
We should maybe prioritize Groovy generating Javascript instead of Javascript generating Javascript/HTML
Basil found some in quite a few plugins, like Jira Software Cloud plugin
emailext has some too!
emailext_template too
testng has a lot of this stuff
test result aggregator
nexus platform plugin too
emailext and jira software cloud plugins should be our priority
Basil will create the tickets for email extension template, nexus platforms, tests results, and so on.
 testng-plugin-plugin/src/main/resources/hudson/plugins/testng/results/ClassResult/reportDetail.groovy
 testng-plugin-plugin/src/main/resources/hudson/plugins/testng/results/PackageResult/reportDetail.groovy
 testng-plugin-plugin/src/main/resources/hudson/plugins/testng/TestNGTestResultBuildAction/reportDetail.groovy
 test-results-aggregator-plugin/src/main/resources/com/jenkins/testresultsaggregator/TestResultsAggregatorTestResultBuildAction/reportDetail.groovy
 nexus-platform-plugin/src/main/resources/org/sonatype/nexus/ci/nxrm/NexusPublisherWorkflowStep/config.groovy

Basil fixed BlueOcean yesterday. Olivier Lamy should release it.

csp plugin has been released
It include a big change (see release notes).
It has been hardened, so it should catch more CSP violations that were previously missed.

# Report Date: Nov 04, 2024
## Current Status
### Progress Summary
#### Build Pipeline Plugin
Shlomo is tackling the complex Build Pipeline plugin, which involves a series of interdependent changes. To ensure stability, he plans to consolidate 7-8 pull requests into a single, comprehensive PR for testing. This approach aims to prevent system breakage that could occur if changes were merged individually. Alternatively, the team might merge the PRs one by one and conduct a thorough test afterward.

#### HTML Publisher and Subversion Plugins
The HTML Publisher plugin has several open PRs, and the Subversion plugin is also actively being worked on. The Publish Over SSH plugin has been merged but is pending release, while the Git Parameters plugin has already been released.

#### Progress Metrics
The team has processed plugins in the 40k installation range, with 60k already completed. The next target is plugins with 22k installations. The Prism API plugin is also in focus, with Basil coordinating with Ulli for PR merges.

#### Active Choices Plugin
Yaroslav has made significant progress on the Active Choices plugin, with a responsive maintainer facilitating the updates. Selenium tests have proven invaluable, catching browser-specific issues that the Acceptance Test Harness (ATH) might miss.

#### SSH and Active Directory Plugins
The SSH plugin has several PRs awaiting review, similar to the Active Directory plugin. These reviews are crucial for the next steps.

#### Future Targets
The Build Pipeline plugin remains a major focus due to its complexity and interdependencies, closely linked with the Delivery Pipeline plugin. Both plugins share similar themes and purposes, making them candidates for similar modernization efforts.

#### Challenging Plugins
The Sonar plugin, managed outside the organization with its own CI, presents unique challenges. The Blue Ocean plugin is temporarily on hold due to testing and building difficulties, and the Artifactory plugin is particularly challenging due to its local installation requirements and maintenance status.

#### Upcoming Updates
IVY and CVS plugins, despite being somewhat obsolete, are still in use and are next in line for updates. The Build Timestamp and Build Monitor plugins are also on the radar, with the latter in good shape for modernization.

#### Automation and Modernization
Automation of the modernization process is expected to be beneficial, especially for older plugins like the Dynamic Extended Choice Parameter plugin. The team is also considering modernizing the GitLab Logo plugin, which is still based on an older Jenkins version.

## Current Status
### Progress Summary
#### CSP Header Implementation
Adding CSP headers will require the use of server filters in Jenkins core to add the necessary headers. This task is deferred until the current list of plugins is addressed.

#### Plugin Updates
- **HTML Publisher**: Despite initial difficulties, the plugin now works and has been released.
- **Publish Over SSH**: Progress is slow due to an unenthusiastic maintainer.
- **Blue Ocean**: On hold due to testing and building difficulties; soon to be deprecated.
- **Sonar Scanner Jenkins**: Merged today.
- **Active Choices**: Progressing slowly as the maintainer requests more unit tests.
- **Warnings NG**: Focused on deleting dead code.
- **Build Pipeline**: Requires more work and is the biggest ongoing task.

#### Targeting Plugins
The team is targeting plugins with 10k installations:
- **Embeddable Build Status**: No longer deprecated.
- **Global Build Stats**: Incomplete but requires minor work.
- **Dockerhub Notification**: Released today.
- **Azure Storage**: Fixed but needs more work.
- **Test Result Reporter**: Near completion.
- **Google Compute Engine**: Completed.
- **Custom Folder Icon**: Completed.

#### Important Plugins
- **Dependency Check**: Still important and actively maintained by Nick Falco.
- **M2Release**: Latest PRs were modernization, but nothing major.
- **Test Results Analyser**: Uncertain importance, worked on by Martin Pokorny.
- **Plugin Usage**: CSP work is ongoing.
- **Robot**: Uncertain status, but CSP work is happening.
- **Delivery Pipeline**: A significant task ahead.
- **Claim**: Still in use.
- **OWASP Dependency Track**: Still in use.
- **View and Parameter Plugins**: Focused on even with low installation numbers.

#### Dead Plugins
- **Port Allocator**: No longer maintained.

# November 26, 2024 - Jenkins CSP Project Update

## Ongoing Challenges
Some key observations from our recent security review:
- Many plugins still generate HTML via JavaScript using `onclick` events
- These haven't been detected by the CSP scanner yet
- Jensec acknowledges the issue but lacks immediate resources to address it
- Basil notes these are relatively rare cases

### Plugins of Concern
- Delivery Pipeline Plugin: Potential inline JavaScript generation
- VManager Plugin: Specific JavaScript concerns in https://github.com/jenkinsci/vmanager-plugin/blob/b90087f1c0ed84ce8fb056715a897b6fe69db3fb/src/main/webapp/js/vmanager_report.js#L12732
- Jira Software Cloud Plugin
- Email Extension Plugin
- TestNG Plugin
- Test Results Aggregator
- Nexus Platform Plugin

Priority files identified:
- `testng-plugin-plugin/src/main/resources/hudson/plugins/testng/results/ClassResult/reportDetail.groovy`
- `testng-plugin-plugin/src/main/resources/hudson/plugins/testng/results/PackageResult/reportDetail.groovy`
- `testng-plugin-plugin/src/main/resources/hudson/plugins/testng/TestNGTestResultBuildAction/reportDetail.groovy`
- `test-results-aggregator-plugin/src/main/resources/com/jenkins/testresultsaggregator/TestResultsAggregatorTestResultBuildAction/reportDetail.groovy`
- `nexus-platform-plugin/src/main/resources/org/sonatype/nexus/ci/nxrm/NexusPublisherWorkflowStep/config.groovy`

- Basil fixed BlueOcean yesterday
- Olivier Lamy is expected to release it
- CSP plugin has been released with significant changes

## Conclusion: Momentum and Progress in November

November has been a remarkable month of systematic security improvements for the Jenkins ecosystem.
The team's focused efforts on Content Security Policy (CSP)
compatibility and plugin modernization have yielded significant results,
with 20 plugins released and many critical updates completed.

The team's strategic approach—focusing on plugins with varying installation bases from 40k to as low as 10k installations—demonstrates a comprehensive commitment to security across the Jenkins plugin landscape.
Notable achievements include modernizing plugins like Build Pipeline, HTML Publisher, Active Choices, and addressing CSP compatibility in critical areas.

Of particular interest is the team's proactive identification of JavaScript-generated HTML and inline event handlers in various plugins.
By prioritizing plugins like Email Extension and Jira Software Cloud,
the team is systematically addressing potential security vulnerabilities that could have gone unnoticed.

As we approach the final month of this project in December,
the groundwork laid in November positions us strongly to complete our security enhancement mission.
The collaborative efforts of team members Shlomo and Yaroslav,
who have been meticulously working on extracting inline scripts and improving plugin compatibility,
exemplify the dedication driving these improvements.

The momentum is clear: Jenkins is becoming more secure, one plugin at a time.

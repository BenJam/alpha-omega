### Progress Summary
build pipeline plugin by Shlomo
Testing pipeline plugin : shlomo will create a big PR to group 7 or 8 PRs together and test them all together because if taken individually, they will break the system.
Or we could merge them one by one, then make a big test with them all once merged.
HTML publisher has PRs opoened
Subversion too
publish over ssh is merged but not released
git parameters released
40k range now, 60k already processed.
prism api, basil will ping Ulli to see if he can help with his plugins PR merged
Yaroslav worked on active choices plugin. The maintainer is responsive.
Selenium tests are pretty helpful as they use real browsers and can catch issues that are not caught by ATH.
SSH plugin prs are waiting for review before getting merged, as active directory plugin too.
22k installation plugins are the next target.
build pipeline is a complicated nest of dependent changes, this will take some time.
Linked to the delivery pipeline plugin. They are very similar in theme, name and purpose.
It's further down the list, but it's a good candidate for a similar treatment.

Once done, will stay Sonar (outside of organization, with their own CI, so kind of hard), Blue Ocean, and artifactory plugin (even harder than the Sonar plugin).

artifactory is not that well maintained, and forces you to install artifactory locally from scratch, which is far from ideal.
It's quite a big plugin, so it will take some time to fix it.

IVY and CVS are still used, are in the 18k range, and are good candidates for the next round of updates. Even if they are kind of obsolete technology.
The build timestamp, build monitor.
Build monitor is in good shape, so that would be good.
7 plugins left to get to 10k.

delivery pipeline was not modernized yet, but automation of modernization would help before the team reaches that point.
gitlab-logo is not modernized, still based on 2.289, but we could give it a try.
dynamic extended choice parameter is also a good candidate for automatic modernization, but it's so old, would it help?

## Current Status
### Progress Summary
adding csp header would necessitate the use of server filters in jenkins core that would add headers
That will wait a little, because we have to go down the list of plugins
We're doing pretty well for this period
html-publisher was difficult, but this now seems to work and has been released
publish-over-ssh has a maintainer who unenthusiastic, so it does not progress well.
blueocean put on hold for now, can't test nor build it easily, soon to be deprecated
sonar-scanner-jenkins was merged today
active-choice is progressing slowly because the maintainer wants some more unit tests
warnings-ng-plugin is mostly deleting dead code
build-pipeline-plugin needs more work, it's gonna take some more time, that's the biggest work in progress
Targetting 10k installation plugins
Embeddable build status was deprecated, but is not deprecated anymore
global-build-stats is incomplete, still some work to do, but should be minor
dockerhub-nortification got released today
azure-storage got fixed, but still some work to do
test-result-reporter should be finished soon
google compute engine is done
custom folder icon is done

dependecy check is important, still used, nick falco is still active => go
m2release, not sure, latest PRs were modernization, but nothing major
test results analyser, not so sure it's important, Martin Pokorny works on it
plugin usage plugin, CSP work was done but not complete, at least, somebody working on it
robot? No idea. Dead plugin? Someone committed to it yesterday. CSP work happening
delivery pipeline will be a big chunk to deal with
claim is still used
owasp dependency track is still used
plugins that add views and paremeters we should focus on even if they have low installation numbers.


port allocator is dead

## Alpha Engagement: Jenkins CSP

The purpose of this Alpha engagement is to improve the [Jenkins implementation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/security/csp/) of [Content Security Policy](https://content-security-policy.com/).
The improvements will be implemented in October, November, and December 2024.
[Shlomo Dahan](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/shlomomdahan) and [Yaroslav Afenkin](https://github.com/yaroslavafenkin) are implementing the improvements with technical guidance from [Basil Crow](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/basil) and project management support from [Bruno Verachten](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/gounthar).

### What is Content Security Policy?
From [content-security-policy.com](https://content-security-policy.com/):
> Content-Security-Policy is the name of a HTTP response header that modern browsers use to enhance the security of the document (or web page). The Content-Security-Policy header allows you to restrict which resources (such as JavaScript, CSS, Images, etc.) can be loaded and the URLs that they can be loaded from.
 
Using Content-Security-Policy (CSP), injection attacks like cross-site scripting can be prevented.

### Monthly update

A report will be created monthly to reveal all efforts made during the last month.

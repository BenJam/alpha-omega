3. Addressing complex plugin suites (Build Pipeline, Delivery Pipeline)

### Plugin Status Updates

#### Active Development
- Sonar Scanner: Successfully merged
- Azure Storage: Fixes in progress
- Test Result Reporter: Near completion

## Looking Forward

### Next Steps
1. Continue focus on high-installation plugins (22k+ range)
2. Address remaining complex plugin suites
3. Prepare for automation of modernization processes
4. Begin planning for CSP header implementation in core

### Key Metrics
- Processed approximately 60,000 installations worth of plugins
- Targeting remaining plugins in 40,000 installation range
- Special focus on remaining 7 plugins needed to reach 10,000 installation milestone

Report Date: Dec 31, 2024
## Current Status
The project is in its last phase for this 3-month funding. We went down to the 10k installation plugins, which proved somehow more difficult, as the maintainers were harder to reach, or much slower to answer. That's why one can see that not all PRs lead to new plugin releases, or even then not all PRs were merged nor even reviewed.
We will have to get those PRs merged thanks to the help of admins.
A good part of these plugins were also vastly outdated, which lead to upgrade them to safe standards before even tackling the CSP flaws.
Nonetheless, we are very proud of the progress me made so far.

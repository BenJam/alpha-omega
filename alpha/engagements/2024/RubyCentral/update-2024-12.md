# Update 2024-12

## RubyGems.org Security Audit

- Closed the loop on the top findings to address
  - Fixed all the low hanging fruit
  - Added static analysis via Semgrep and Zizmor to prevent regressions on many of the fixes, since that is how ToB found them
- Collaborated with Trail of Bits to put out a pair of blog posts about the process, the findings, and our take on RubyGems.org's overall security posture

## Sigstore

- [Improved display](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/5330) of trusted provenance on RubyGems.org
- Wrote a proof-of-concept to support JRuby in sigstore-ruby
  - Lack of support was noticed by many of the core ruby gems, which have already adopted trusted publishing & sigstore signing
- Set up infrastructure to track adoption of sigstore attestations amongst top X gems, similar to https://github.com/meshy/pythonwheels

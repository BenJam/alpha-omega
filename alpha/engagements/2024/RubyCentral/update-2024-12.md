# Update 2024-12

## Organizations

We completed the code for managing organization members.  There are a few places in our existing workflows where the new Organization isn’t fully represented yet.  All of this functionality is locked behind a feature flag so it’s not visible to the public.

The next step is to test the onboarding flows internally before demoing the workflows with one of our key customers, the AWS gem team, to collect feedback.  The goal in the next two months is to onboard a few customers in a private beta before moving to limited availability.

In November, we used up the remaining funds from the grant so the pace of work slowed down after RubyConf. We covered development through a mix of volunteering and selective use of our maintenance budget.  We will explore how to fund the remaining work once we have a sense of its scope.

### RubyGems.org Security Audit

- Closed the loop on the top findings to address
  - Fixed all the low hanging fruit
  - Added static analysis via Semgrep and Zizmor to prevent regressions on many of the fixes, since that is how ToB found them
- Collaborated with Trail of Bits to put out a pair of blog posts about the process, the findings, and our take on RubyGems.org's overall security posture

### Sigstore

- [Improved display](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/5330) of trusted provenance on RubyGems.org
- Wrote a proof-of-concept to support JRuby in sigstore-ruby
  - Lack of support was noticed by many of the core ruby gems, which have already adopted trusted publishing & sigstore signing
- Set up infrastructure to track adoption of sigstore attestations amongst top X gems, similar to https://github.com/meshy/pythonwheels
 
### Other Items

#### RubyGems 3.6 / Ruby 3.4 Release

- Fixed backwards/forwards compatibility
- Upgraded infrastructure to run on latest release

#### Prototyped Ruby Version Manager

- https://github.com/segiddins/chrb
- A place for a working group attempting to standardize on local ruby version management to be able to experiment with new setups
- Features like running a matrix of rubies that make maintaining core infra like rubygems easier

#### RubyGems SafeMarshal Improvements

- Multiple classes used as gadgets in recent PoC were hardened
- Buffer overread that allowed for arbitrary marshal deserialization addressed


## Marty Haught

Marty prepared a 2025 budget and roadmap for internal review.  This was the first budget ever produced for the open source program.  It included three variations based on how successful our fundraising efforts would be.  Even with the pessimistic budget, we will be able to sustain lean operations.  This would form the basis for a presentation Marty gave to our core sponsors on Dec 11th.  He included 2024 accomplishments and the 2025 outlook based on current support.  Initial feedback was that sponsors would like to see more detail in how open source funds were spent.  This was valuable feedback as he made adjustments to the final annual report that will be prepared in January once our financials have settled.

Work began on the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy for RubyGems.org.  Aaron Williamson shared a draft of the Privacy Policy that Marty will review and discuss with Aaron before sharing it more broadly with the team.  Marty will be working on a data map to document how we process data on RubyGems.org.

Next up, Marty will oversee how the Organizations work can move forward with our limited budget and explore ways to fund the work.  After that, he’ll start the assessment of team access of cloud services and infrastructure.

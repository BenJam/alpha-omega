# Update 2024-10

## Organizations

Onboarding is complete and merged.
We are currently finishing the remaining interactions and views so that we can release.
We presented a preview of the feature in mid-November at RubyConf in Chicago.

### Next steps:

There are only a few remaining pieces:

* Allow adding and removing gems _after_ onboarding.
* Finish the process for receiving and accepting an invitation to join an organization.
* Ensure public vs private views for Organizations are rendered correctly.

## Audit

### Next steps:

* Coordinating with Trail of Bits to finish our response and release a shared statement.

## New era of slop security reports for open source

Wrote and [published an article about low-quality and LLM-hallucinated security reports](https://sethmlarson.dev/slop-security-reports)
that appear to be getting more frequent for open source projects like Python and curl.
The article was covered extensively, being quoted in
[The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/10/ai_slop_bug_reports/) and [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2024/12/10/fortune-brainstorm-ai-promises-reality/).

## Ultralytics supply-chain attack analysis

The PyPI package "[Ultralytics](https://pypi.org/project/ultralytics)" which has a medium-sized userbase was compromised
through a supply-chain attack on its GitHub Actions infrastructure using cache-poisoning.
Published [analysis through the PyPI blog](https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2024-12-11-ultralytics-attack-analysis/), this analysis spurred projects to adopt Zizmor among other
advice to secure workflows. Worked on the analysis of this attack with [William Woodruff](https://blog.yossarian.net/2024/12/06/zizmor-ultralytics-injection).

## Debian package for Sigstore

Debian has a new [experimental packaging of Cosign](https://lists.debian.org/debian-go/2024/12/msg00005.html) to be used
to verify Sigstore verification materials. I gave this package a spin and was able
to verify the Sigstore materials for CPython. I also linked up the Debian developer
responsible for this new package to the developers of Sigstore to talk about the long-term
packaging of Cosign.

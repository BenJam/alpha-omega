## Solving the "Phantom Dependency problem" for Python packages

Python packages have a "phantom dependency" problem, many packages
contain non-Python software (C, C++, Rust, Go, JavaScript, etc) that
can't be described using Python packaging metadata. This means that
software composition analysis tools often miss this software. Python
is particularly affected by this issue, but many software ecosystems
have the exact same problem.

The proposal to solve this issue is providing a mechanism to describe
cross-technology software within Python packaging metadata using SBOMs.

Seth has authored a draft Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) and has circulated the draft within the
Python packaging reviewers, SBOM standards communities (both SPDX and CycloneDX),
SBOM users working groups. The PEP would provide a mechanism to bundle self-describing
SBOM documents into Python package archives. The draft has a sponsor and reviewer:
Brett Cannon.

Seth created a fork of auditwheel that implements the draft PEP and p[ublished
a case study](https://sethmlarson.dev/early-promising-results-with-sboms-and-python-packages) showing
that by adding SBOM data to Python wheels that SCA tools are able to
properly detect all bundled software within the archive.

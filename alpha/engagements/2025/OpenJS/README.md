# OpenJS Foundation 2025 Alpha-Omega Grant

## Summary

The 2025 OpenJS Foundation Alpha-Omega Grant funds Security Engineering Champions who will supplement and build from the initiatives created through prior year’s funding from the Sovereign Tech Fund and Alpha Omega, with broader PM, marketing and program administrative support from the foundation. Together, we will collaborate to advance security skills and processes among the contributor and implementer communities to strengthen the JavaScript ecosystem broadly, and provide direct support to the most critical projects in the OpenJS project portfolio.

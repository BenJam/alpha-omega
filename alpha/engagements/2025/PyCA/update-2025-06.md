# PyCA Cryptography Declarative ASN.1 API: June 2025

## Completed

* Added decoding support for `GeneralizedTime`, `UTCTime`, `BIT STRING`,
  and `NULL`
    - https://github.com/trailofbits/cryptography-asn1/pull/20
* Added initial X509 definitions and decoding tests using actual certificates
    - https://github.com/trailofbits/cryptography-asn1/pull/20
* Refactored decoding logic to unify decoding of builtin types and
  user-defined types
   - https://github.com/trailofbits/cryptography-asn1/pull/21
* Added support for specifying `SIZE` constrains with only one of `MIN` or
  `MAX`
   - https://github.com/trailofbits/cryptography-asn1/pull/22
* Added initial encoding support
   - https://github.com/trailofbits/cryptography-asn1/pull/23
* Fixed incorrect type annotations
   - https://github.com/trailofbits/cryptography-asn1/pull/24
* Added encoding support for `EXPLICIT`, `IMPLICIT` and `DEFAULT` annotations
   - https://github.com/trailofbits/cryptography-asn1/pull/25
* Added encoding support for `SEQUENCE`, `SEQUENCE OF`, `CHOICE` and `OPTIONAL`
   - https://github.com/trailofbits/cryptography-asn1/pull/25

As part of the above, we made the following changes to `rust-asn1`:

* Re-added the `Writer::write_{explicit,implicit}_element` APIs
    - https://github.com/alex/rust-asn1/pull/563

## In progress

* Began initial support for custom error types in `rust-asn1` encoding API
    - https://github.com/alex/rust-asn1/pull/562

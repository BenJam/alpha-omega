# Alpha Engagement: PyCA Cryptography Declarative ASN.1 API

The purpose of this Alpha engagement is to fund the development of
a declarative ASN.1 API for [PyCA Cryptography](https://cryptography.io/),
the de facto standard cryptography library for Python.

This API will allow developers to declare ASN.1 structures as Python
classes and perform DER serialization/deserialization against them. The
internals of this API will be developed against
[rust-asn1](https://github.com/alex/rust-asn1), which already underlies
PyCA Cryptography's internal use of ASN.1 and DER.

## Timeline

This engagement started in January 2025.

# PyCA Cryptography Declarative ASN.1 API

*Logistical note*: This is our first status update, and reflects
only a limited number of hours used this month.

## In progress

* Began design and initial development on the Python components of the
  declarative ASN.1, including a `dataclasses`-style public API,
  `typing.Annotated` support, and an intermediate representation suitable
  for use within the Rust components.

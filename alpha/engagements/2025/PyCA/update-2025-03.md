# PyCA Cryptography Declarative ASN.1 API: March 2025

*Logistical note*: We spent marginal hours on this project in March 2025.
As such, our update primarily reflects the previous month's ongoing tasks.

## In progress

* Continued development on the Rust internals, including MVP support
  for serialization and deserialization.
* Began design of non-trivial annotation support, including
  support for `IMPLICIT`, `EXPLICIT`, etc. ASN.1 markers.

# PyCA Cryptography Declarative ASN.1 API: April 2025

## Completed

* Completed initial support for `IMPLICIT` and `EXPLICIT` markers
    - https://github.com/trailofbits/cryptography-asn1/pull/6
* Completed initial support for `ANY` and `DEFINED BY`
    - https://github.com/trailofbits/cryptography-asn1/pull/11
* Completed initial support for `EXPLICIT CHOICE`
    - https://github.com/trailofbits/cryptography-asn1/pull/8
* Refactored `ObjectIdentifier` handling
    - https://github.com/trailofbits/cryptography-asn1/pull/2

As part of the above, we made the following changes to `rust-asn1`:

* Made `Parser::peek_tag` public
    - https://github.com/alex/rust-asn1/pull/532
* Re-added the `Parser::read_{explicit,implicit}_element` APIs
    - https://github.com/alex/rust-asn1/pull/533
* Improved the API documentation for `CHOICE` handling
    - https://github.com/alex/rust-asn1/pull/535

Additionally, we performed the following public announcements:

## In progress

* Began initial support for constraints via `SIZE` for `SEQUENCE OF`
    - https://github.com/trailofbits/cryptography-asn1/pull/12
* Began refactoring in preparation for integration with PyCA Cryptography,
  including reducing the minimum Python version to 3.8 and simplifying the
  CI:

    - https://github.com/trailofbits/cryptography-asn1/pull/13
    - https://github.com/trailofbits/cryptography-asn1/pull/14
* Began redesigning the `CHOICE`, `ANY` and `DEFINED BY` APIs to improve
  typechecker support

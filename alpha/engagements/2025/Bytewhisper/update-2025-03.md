# Alpha Omega Project Status Report

## Status – March H1

- Met with OSTIF representatives
- Provided a list of key candidate projects to OSTIF based on the AI Library reports; awaiting detailed reporting from their reviews
- Bytewhisper team began forking target projects and setting up CodeQL and other scanners to generate guidance and learnings before maintainer meetings

### Key Notes:
- Projects using **Python** and **JavaScript** are easy plug-and-play
- **False positives** are expected in scans
  - *Example false positive*: An API URL was mistakenly identified as a hard-coded credential
- **True finding** example:
  - A hardcoded default password `'pleaseletmein'` exists in a Python script if the user doesn't customize it.
  - Could be mitigated with runtime warnings if setup is incomplete.
- Projects in **C/C++** are not plug-and-play; may need customized YAML files for proper integration
- Exploring **Snyk** for higher-quality findings
- Initial guides are being developed for scanning implementation to streamline onboarding of maintainers

### Early Scan Results (Untriaged)

## Status – March H2

- Scaled back CodeQL testing to a single repo to troubleshoot challenges
  - Selected **PROJECT_4** for its diverse languages to better test build functionality
- Found that adding CodeQL action to GitHub can trigger other workflows
  - Triggered by conditions like `push to main`
  - Solution: Implement CodeQL in a separate branch to reduce unnecessary actions
- Ensuring CodeQL is targeting *used* languages, not just present languages
  - Legacy/deprecated code is still sometimes scanned unnecessarily
  - Repos should be reviewed by contributing and security teams for relevance
- Build instructions should be explicitly added in the `run` section of the CodeQL YAML
  - Default `run` commands cause `exit 1`, halting scans with no results

### Observations:
- Some candidate repos already have CodeQL workflows, but often they are default/no-op scripts
- Languages like **C/C++**, **C#**, **Rust**, and **Java-Kotlin** require custom build configs
  - Default GitHub CodeQL actions often fail on these without proper setup

### Key Notes:
- Python and JavaScript projects remain easy plug-and-play
- Java-Kotlin, C#, and C/C++ need **custom build commands** based on environment (e.g., Windows, Ubuntu, MacOS)
  - Scans will typically run in **Docker Linux** environments
- CodeQL should be **initially implemented in a scanning branch**
  - Prevents disruptions to existing GitHub Actions
  - Eventually can work with contributors to merge into `main`
- Deeper codebase understanding = more valuable and accurate results
- **Threat modeling** each repo would maximize security effort ROI
- Planning additional documentation deliverables:
  - Hardening guides
  - Security testing guides
  - Vulnerability triage guides
  - Security advisory board with known vuln tracking & recommendations

## Other Activities
- Selected 4 projects for reach-out to discuss remediation efforts and offer help
  - Work falls into several buckets: threat model, documentation, code remediation, SDLC, other advisory.
- Produced blog post on defense against prompt injection when building with open source tooling.

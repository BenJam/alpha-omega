# Eclipse Foundation Update — February 2025  

## Mini-Reviews of Eclipse Foundation Projects  

The team held a two-day face-to-face meeting after FOSDEM in Brussels. The focus of the meeting was to refine the mini-reviews workflow. These mini-reviews serve a dual purpose: first, to reinforce and strengthen existing best practices; and second, to provide an entry point for engaging with projects we haven't yet had the opportunity to collaborate with. By offering targeted guidance and feedback, we aim to initiate meaningful conversations and build stronger relationships across a broader range of projects.  

We have already conducted three mini-reviews internally and have begun discussions with the associated projects. Additionally, we have drafted initial documentation detailing the structure of these mini-reviews, available in our [security handbook](https://eclipse-csi.github.io/security-handbook/project/reviews.html).  

Our goal is to scale up this process and complete 35 mini-reviews by the end of the year.  

## Repository Configuration  

We have officially released [version 1.0 of Eclipse Otterdog](https://github.com/eclipse-csi/otterdog/releases/tag/v1.0.0), marking a significant milestone in promoting the tool's adoption by other organizations. The Otterdog backend is available as a ready-to-use Docker image published on [GHCR](https://github.com/eclipse-csi/otterdog/pkgs/container/otterdog/364702838?tag=1.0.0) and is also distributed via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/otterdog/) using trusted publishing workflows.  

Eclipse Otterdog is compliant with SLSA Build Level 3 and publishes [provenance attestations](https://github.com/eclipse-csi/otterdog/releases/download/v1.0.0/multiple.intoto.jsonl) for its releases.  

## ID Validation of Maintainers  

We have started evaluating government-issued ID validation platforms. Our assessment covered various aspects, including documentation, services, security posture, regulatory compliance, and pricing. The platforms we reviewed include:  

- [Incode](https://incode.com)  
- [iDenfy](https://www.idenfy.com)  
- [Persona](https://withpersona.com)  
- [Trulioo](https://www.trulioo.com)  

We also explored the feasibility and potential advantages of using LinkedIn as an ID verification source. Since LinkedIn already offers a similar service, we considered leveraging their existing process as an option. However, we encountered several limitations:  

- LinkedIn does not expose identity verification information through its profile API.  
- The available OpenID token fields are insufficient for determining verification status.  
- LinkedIn enforces strict anti-scraping and anti-crawling policies, preventing us from extracting this information directly from the website.  

Following our evaluation, **iDenfy** emerged as the frontrunner. It offers broad support for over 190 countries and 30+ languages, direct API integrations, and comprehensive documentation, including walkthroughs for setting up verification flows. Additionally, it provides verification analytics and filters to analyze volume and common rejection reasons. It is also GDPR and CCPA compliant, SOC 2 (assumed Type I) certified, and ISO 27001 certified.  

Our next step is to schedule a demo and sales discussion with iDenfy to develop an initial MVP with this platform.  

## Vulnerability Management  

We have published several CVEs for vulnerabilities that have had fixes in the works for some time:  

- **OpenVSX**: [CVE-2025-1007](https://github.com/eclipse/openvsx/security/advisories/GHSA-wc7c-xq2f-qp4h) – A fix is available in versions **0.21.0** and **0.19.1**.  
- **ThreadX (NetXDuo module)**: Three CVEs have been addressed in version **6.4.2**:  
  - [CVE-2025-0726](https://github.com/eclipse-threadx/netxduo/security/advisories/GHSA-pwf8-5q9w-m763)  
  - [CVE-2025-0727](https://github.com/eclipse-threadx/netxduo/security/advisories/GHSA-jf6x-9mgc-p72w)  
  - [CVE-2025-0728](https://github.com/eclipse-threadx/netxduo/security/advisories/GHSA-hqp7-4q26-6wqf)  
- **Eclipse OMR**:  
  - [CVE-2025-1470](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-1470)  
  - [CVE-2025-1471](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-1471)  

## Team Updates  

We are sad to see Thomas Neidhart leave our team at the end of February. However, we are thrilled that he is taking on a new opportunity at the Apache Software Foundation. His skills and contributions have been invaluable, and we wish him all the best in his next endeavor. We also hope that his new role will pave the way for stronger collaboration between our teams and Apache.

On a positive note, we have finalized the hiring of an additional team member (not a direct replacement for Thomas), who will start on March 10. Welcome Kairo de Araujo, a well-known contributor in the community, particularly for his work on TUF, RSTUF, and in-toto.  

That said, we still have [one open position](https://eclipsefoundation.applytojob.com/apply/VYeaNcgocL/Security-Software-Engineer-Open-Source) to replace Thomas.

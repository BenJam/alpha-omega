# Eclipse Foundation Update — June 2025

## Open VSX Registry

On May 4th, the Eclipse Foundation (EF) Security Team received a notification from researchers at [Koi Security](https://www.koi.security) concerning a potential vulnerability in the Eclipse Open VSX marketplace extension publication process. The EF Security Team promptly informed the Eclipse Open VSX team, and, after confirming the issue, work on a fix was immediately initiated.

Following multiple iterations and thorough testing—necessary due to the intrusive nature of the changes to the extension build process—the fix was successfully deployed on June 24th. A [comprehensive security advisory](https://blogs.eclipse.org/post/mikaël-barbero/eclipse-open-vsx-registry-security-advisory) was published shortly thereafter.

While no evidence of compromise was found, 81 extensions were proactively deactivated as a precautionary measure. The standard publishing process remained unaffected. Recommendations have been issued to help mitigate future risks.

## Otterdog improvements

We have addressed several reported issues in Otterdog, notably:

* Properly escaping string values when passing them to a rich Console.
* Adding support for marking organizations as archived and excluding them from processing.
* Introducing a new `check-status` CLI command, which outputs a JSON file detailing the sync, validation, and archival status of organizations.
* Fixing a regression affecting live settings and the expected default setup for code scanning.

A new release is expected soon.

The new contributor guide is [now available](https://otterdog.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/). Not only has it been revised, but significant effort has been made to simplify the contribution process. Notably, the development environment provisioning is now fully based on [Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/), [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/), and optionally [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) for testing the GitHub app.

## Security training

The security training on vulnerability management, SBOM, and related subjects took place on June 3 and June 10, and the [videos are now available online](https://blogs.eclipse.org/post/marta-rybczynska/security-training-vulnerability-management-and-sboms-videos-are-online). We had 137 attendees out of 275 registered participants. Although this training was funded by the Sovereign Tech Agency rather than Alpha-Omega, we wanted to share this content with the Alpha-Omega community.

# Eclipse Foundation Update — March 2025

## Rapid Security Reviews of Eclipse Foundation Projects

We have initiated 5 Rapid Security Reviews for Eclipse Foundation projects. The first review reports are scheduled for publication in April.

Additionally, we have identified 19 more projects to undergo Rapid Security Reviews starting in Q2.

We also held a meeting with OSTIF to discuss alignment opportunities regarding similar security review services offered by their organization.

## Repository Configuration

Following Thomas Neidhart's departure, who was previously the most active contributor to the repository configuration effort, we addressed the gap by assigning two team members to gain proficiency with the codebase. Significant improvements are underway, particularly in enhancing the developer onboarding documentation and installation guidelines.

## ID Validation of Maintainers

We have finalized the contractual agreement with iDenfy. The development team is actively engaged in planning and creating the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for maintainer identity validation.

## Management of `tj-actions`

In response to the recent supply chain attack affecting the `tj-actions` GitHub Actions (alongside other potentially compromised actions), we proactively assessed all Eclipse Foundation projects for exposure risks.

Across our ecosystem, there are over 1,270 repositories utilizing GitHub Actions, spread across 266 GitHub organizations. Our assessment identified 12 workflows potentially affected. Among these, only 2 workflows provided high-level token privileges, and only one actively utilized a secret other than `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Nevertheless, we thoroughly reviewed logs from all 131 executions of these workflows within the vulnerability time window and found no evidence of secret leakage.

We communicated findings proactively to affected projects, some of which continue to explore mitigation strategies, such as pinning all actions explicitly. Completed analyses from specific projects are publicly available:

- [Eclipse Tractus-X](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/vulnerability-reports/-/issues/267)
- [Eclipse iceoryx](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/vulnerability-reports/-/issues/270)

## SLSA Source Track Proof-of-Concept (PoC)

We engaged with the maintainer of the [slsa-source-poc](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-source-poc) project to explore potential integration with Otterdog. The goal is to validate that repository configurations—such as branch protection settings and required checks—are consistently synchronized with Otterdog. This integration aims to ensure a verifiable, tamper-proof history of repository configuration changes.

## Team Updates

We welcomed Kairo Araujo to the team, who joined on March 10. Welcome aboard, Kairo!

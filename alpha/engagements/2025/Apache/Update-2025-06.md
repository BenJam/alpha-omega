# The Apache Software Foundation - June 2025

## Apache Trusted Release (ATR) platform

We have been working since February on the new pipeline with a focus on properly following Apache Release Policy. Once that is stable we plan a series of additional features before we proceed to a working Beta later this year.

- We started an internal Alpha Test of the new pipeline with six PMCs so far: Airflow, Commons, Logging, Maven, Pekko, and Tomcat. Good initial feedback.
- Initial focus for the Alpha Test is the pipeline implemention of our ASF policy gates.
- We are also refining tooling to encourage our communities to self-identify all of their projects/products.
- We are discussing preferred locations and file formats to best provide the public with information about project releases. This has historically been provided via widely used yet optional DOAP files in any of a number of different url patterns.
- We are planning upgrades of our Nexus2 repository - https://repository.apache.org/ to Nexus3 allowing modern workflows and more distribution channel options.
- We are working on tooling with the ASF Board so that our tooling will quickly move communities with their projects and releases through their lifecycle.

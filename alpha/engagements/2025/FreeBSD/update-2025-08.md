# FreeBSD Update - August 2025

## Immediate tasks

The migration to OpenSSL 3.5 was completed in time to match the schedule of the
coming major release of FreeBSD, 15.0. The integration work was not perfectly
executed for all of the architectures supported, but the issues identified were
resolved within a few days.

A new timeline was defined and adopted, with the first task set to create an
inventory of third-party software used in the base system of FreeBSD.

### OpenSSL 3.5

Pierre Pronchery has pushed the update for the 3.5.1 release of OpenSSL to the
`main` branch of FreeBSD on August 8th. He resumed active duty on August 25th
after that:

* Fix for 32-bit platforms
* Fix for the legacy provider, [D52113](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D52113)
* Fix cross-building on platforms without KTLS support,
  [D52341](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D52341)
* Reviews for proposed changes by ngie@ for more automation during future
  imports

### Additional planning

The official kick-off meeting with Michael Winser had to be postponed to
September 3rd. The project went ahead regardless, with a timeline finalized and
announced publicly on a new repository on August 28th, on
[GitHub](https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/alpha-omega-beach-cleaning).

It is reproduced here in a simpler form:

| Phase                          | Start date | End date   |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| Inventory of dependencies      | 25/08/2025 | 07/09/2025 |
| Security risk assessments      | 08/09/2025 | 21/09/2025 |
| Propose list of priorities     | 22/09/2025 | 28/09/2025 |
| Plan the respective actions    | 29/09/2025 | 26/10/2025 |
| Formalize code owners          | 27/10/2025 | 30/11/2025 |
| Integrate review methodologies |      _continuous_      ||
| Plan execution & coordination  |      _continuous_      ||
| Final report                   | 09/03/2026 | 30/03/2026 |

### Task: Inventory of dependencies

Work started on the inventory of third-party software used in the base system,
regardless of the respective scope: build dependency, boot-time/firmware, kernel
code, toolchain or run-time support, system or network service, libraries,
cryptography, or applications.

Some software is written by official FreeBSD developers but hosted or maintained
outside of the FreeBSD project itself; these dependencies will be listed in this
list as well.

This task re-uses and completes existing documentation from the FreeBSD project,
as can be found in the
[MAINTAINERS](https://github.com/FreeBSD/freebsd-src/blob/main/MAINTAINERS)
file.

# FreeBSD Update - June 2025

## Immediate tasks

FreeBSD's [next major release](https://www.freebsd.org/releng/), 15.0, is
scheduled for release in December 2025.

Its [detailed release process](https://www.freebsd.org/releases/15.0R/schedule/)
has already started however, where new features for 15.0 should be introduced no
later than August 8th, 2025 - which is around the corner.

A list of blockers was elaborated during a [FreeBSD
DevSummit](https://wiki.freebsd.org/DevSummit/202506) prior to the [BSDCan
conference](https://www.bsdcan.org/2025/) in June 2025. Several of them are
security-relevant or related to dependencies of the base system of FreeBSD, as
found in its [src](https://github.com/FreeBSD/freebsd-src.git) Git repository:

* Migration to OpenSSL 3.5
* Update to OpenZFS 2.4 (or latest stable)

These are the first obvious and critical dependencies to address in the context
of the Beach Cleaning project. While the OpenZFS side already has two committers
designated as the owners for the status of this code in the coming release (mav@
and mm@), it was not the case for the migration of OpenSSL to its latest
version, 3.5.

### OpenSSL 3.5

Anyone familiar with the [heartbleed vulnerability](https://heartbleed.com/)
will understand how critical a component [OpenSSL](https://openssl-library.org/)
is for major Open Source projects. FreeBSD is no exception, and its release
schedule combined with the [Long-Term Support timeline of
OpenSSL](https://openssl-library.org/policies/releasestrat/index.html) dictates
an urgent migration to the latest version of OpenSSL, 3.5.0:

* OpenSSL 3.0 (LTS) will reach end-of-life on September 7th, 2026
* OpenSSL 3.5 (LTS) will reach end-of-life on April 8th, 2030
* FreeBSD 15 is expected to reach end-of-life in December 2030

This will reduce the window of responsibility for the FreeBSD community to be
maintaining its own copy of OpenSSL 3.5 to about 8 months, as opposed to over
four years if OpenSSL is kept at version 3.0 in the coming FreeBSD release.

As a result, the migration to version 3.5 has been identified as the single,
most important project to be focusing on during this initiative until
completion. This work is currently in progress and performed by [Pierre
Pronchery](https://github.com/khorben) of the [FreeBSD
Foundation](https://freebsdfoundation.org/) in his [clone of FreeBSD's
src](https://github.com/khorben/freebsd-src.git) repository.

# FreeBSD Update - July 2025

## Immediate tasks

The migration to OpenSSL 3.5 remains a blocker for the coming major release of
FreeBSD, 15.0. A tentative series of commits, comprising a vendor merge and
integration steps, is now pending review.

### OpenSSL 3.5

Pierre Pronchery has kept on working on the integration branch for OpenSSL 3.5
during the month of July, with the following milestones achieved:

* Vendor update for the latest release of OpenSSL, 3.5.1
* Review of the changes since 3.5.0
* Build capability on every hardware architecture to be supported by FreeBSD in
  the 15.0 release: amd64, i386, arm64, arm, powerpc64, powerpc64le, riscv
  (64-bit)
* Build capability on legacy hardware architectures: powerpc (32-bit)
* Generation and import of the new manual pages
* Rebasing on the latest [stabweek tag](https://wiki.freebsd.org/StabWeeks) for
  the base system, for testing by Netflix
* Update of the symbol list for API compatibility
* Review in progress in Phabricator, at
  [D51613](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D51613)

The tentative branch for the merge is now
[khorben/openssl-3.5.1-stabweek-2025-Jul](https://github.com/khorben/freebsd-src/tree/khorben/openssl-3.5.1-stabweek-2025-Jul) on GitHub.

The objective is to merge this branch before August 8th, scheduled as the
feature cut for FreeBSD 15.0.

### Additional planning

Internal meetings were held by the [FreeBSD
Foundation](https://freebsdfoundation.org), in order to plan and deliver on the
steps past the OpenSSL 3.5 integration.

### CocoaPods Supply Chain Security

Unfortunately, Samuel again spent a fair amount of time this month responding to supply chain concerns in the other packaging ecosystem he is responsible for, CocoaPods.
On the bright side, much of that time this month was directed towards efforts to safely wind down that package repository.
Expect collaboration with the OpenSSF Securing Software Repositories Working Group in conjunction with phased mitigation of concerns in the future.

### Ruby Kaigi

Along with other members of the team, Samuel attended Ruby Kaigi (Japan's premier annual Ruby conference) in Matsuyama, Japan this month.
In addition to attending the conference, Samuel participated in the co-located Ruby Developer Meeting and also delivered a talk around the challenges of building the [sigstore-ruby](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-ruby) sigstore client.

Most importantly, Samuel was able to have several crucial in-person discussions with the folks building ruby:

* With the JRuby team: what is path forward for crypto primitives, and how can Samuel help get JRuby to parity with MRI
* Ruby Core: Samuel discussed the [state of ruby release build reproducibility](https://traveling.engineer/posts/ruby-release-reproducibility/), and ruby core accepted in principle the proposed improvements. Next up will be testing and making the archive build reproducible. Eventually, reproducibility of the built and installed binaries could be tackled as a follow-up.
* gGem native extensions: There was another conference talk on this subject, intersecting with the ongoing "wheels" work. Additionally, discussed what a more declarative build system could look like for extensions, replacing `extconf.rb` and `mkmf` which are hard to understand, slow due to serial execution, replicate duplicate work across different extensions.

### Wheels

Samuel received a lot more feedback than expected on the initial wheels proposal over the past month, so development work slowed to allow time to synthesize ruby community feedback with (in progress) OpenSSF SSRWG guidance. Samuel is now spearheading a working group effort to define best practices around precompiled binaries in packages, which will inform the direction rubygems takes going forward. Ruby feedback is currently being collected in a [discussion](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/discussions/8645), with the goal of coming to a proposal that has consensus support soon.

### Ecosystem Data

Samuel wrapped up the project to send ecosystem data to Clickhouse. Clickhouse [publicly announced](https://clickhouse.com/blog/announcing-ruby-gem-analytics-powered-by-clickhouse) availability of the data, and Samuel quickly proved its usefulness by sharing `jruby`-specific usage information with the JRuby team at Kaigi.

### Other Items

* Integrated API key secret scanning with deps.dev
* Improved database monitoring of rubygems.org, leading to actionable insights on missing indices that might have caused prior outages
* Ensured that data on missing packages was not inadvertantly published, reducing the attack surface for slopsquatting.

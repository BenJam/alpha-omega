## RubyGems.org Policies

Along with Marty, I've spent a fair amount of time honing on the policies we're going to roll out for rubygems.org. This involved some cataloging of the data we collect and use, existing rules (as implemented in the codebase) around gem namespaces and yanking, and what capabilities we want to reserve for ourselves in the future. Additionally, we've started thinking about what will be necessary to roll out the policies on a technical level.

## Sigstore

### sigstore-ruby

The sigstore-ruby client is just about ready for a `0.3.0` release, bringing improved spec compliance and jruby support. The jruby support proved extremely tricky, as it required re-implementing some cryptographic operations using the java security APIs instead of the `jruby-openssl` gem.

### Ecosystem Adoption

There's now a tracker for adoption of sigstore amongst the most popular gems at https://segiddins.github.io/are-we-attested-yet/. We're up to 20 of the top gems shipping attestations, and I've been working directly with maintainers of some of those top gems to help them adopt sigstore signing into their release workflows.

## "Wheels" For RubyGems

I've been working on a proposal for "wheels" for RubyGems, which would allow gem authors to ship precompiled binaries of their gems whenever possible (instead of the gem building an extension at install time). This is better for security -- no code running at install time, and more ergonomic for users -- no need to install build tools, deal with build errors, waiting for slow compilation. An outline of the project goals has been published at https://traveling.engineer/posts/goals-for-binary-gems/, and some implementation sketches are in the works.

## Other Items

* Started work on Ruby release tarball reproducibility. Expect a blog post in the next couple of weeks outlining my findings, and in April I will be talking with Ruby Core about what we can do to make releases bitwise reproducible.
* Gave a talk at the KRUG (Krakow Ruby User Group) February 2025 meetup about the Future of Ruby Supply Chain Security
* Gave a workshop on modernizing gem development practices at Ruby Community Conference 2025, helping maintainers set up trusted publishing & sigstore signing
* Continued work on a standard for binary transparency for package repositories

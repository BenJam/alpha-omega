# Update 2025-03

### CocoaPods Supply Chain Security

Unfortunately, Samuel spent a fair amount of time this month responding to supply chain concerns in the _other_ packaging ecosystem he is responsible for, CocoaPods. Due to the ongoing nature of those concerns, this update will refrain from talking about specifics, but Samuel investigated, mitigated, and discussed with the security community a series of attacks carried out against the package registry.

### "Wheels" For RubyGems

Samuel has made progress on implementing improved precompiled binary packages for RubyGems, settling on a naming scheme for package files and the set of identifying tags the Ruby ecosystem will require. Next up is continuing to evangelize to the Ruby community _why_ precompiled binaries are desireable, despite preconceived notions they are less secure than everyone compiling native extensions from downloaded packages.

### Ecosystem Data

Samuel worked to push ecosystem data into ClickHouse, in the spirit of the wonderful [clickpy](https://clickpy.clickhouse.com/) site. ClickHouse now has daily download totals for gems in addition to the latest public database dumps from RubyGems.org, and granular download data is in the process of being rolled out. Sending a row for each download from the RubyGems.org CDN required retooling the [kirby](https://github.com/rubytogether/kirby) log parser to stream output from the CDN access logs. This granular data will unlock new insights into package usage for the Ruby community, and will hopefully give package maintainers the information they need to make informed decisions around supported platforms.

### Policies Rollout

In addition to the work on defining the policies RubyGems.org is currently seeking comment on, Samuel worked to roll those policies out to the website and the site's users. Work was started on tracking acknowledgement of the new policies, making sure users were notified of the policies, and eventually requiring policy agreement to continue creating or modifying resources on the site.

### Other Items

* A brief DOS against RubyGems.org necessitated an investigation into some web pages that have extremely heavy database queries. Nothing concrete has come of the investigation, but it's another reminder that visibility into database performance is paramount to running a web system at scale.

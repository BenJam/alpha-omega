### Gems with Prebuilt Binaries

Samuel [finished refactoring](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/8703) `Gem::Platform` matching logic that was in Bundler to live in RubyGems, in preparation for `wheel` support to hit both projects simultaneously. Samuel has already used this refactor to [improve platform](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/8751) selection in the RubyGems CLI, picking the best platform gem that matches the running platform. Overall, this work will enable sharing code for new platform matching between Bundler & RubyGems. Samuel spent the majority of the month prototyping ways to shove the new platform information for wheels into platform strings in a backwards-compatible way. As a part of this prototyping work, Samuel finished research on how to translate python’s platform tags to the ruby ecosystem. The conclusion is that rubygems won’t need a separate ABI tag from the Ruby tag, since ruby implementations tend not to have stable ABIs, unlike CPython. Expect a PR demonstrating wheels to hit in the coming month.

### Binary Transparency

Samuel continued discussions at Open Source Summit North America around creating a binary transparency scheme that will work across packaging repositories. This included developing a more comprehensive threat model that BT is meant to address, in addition to sketching out a deployment plan that will involve the different package registries witnessing each others BT logs.

### Sigstore Ruby

Samuel led a discussion at the Sigstore meetup at OSS NA around helping Sigstore client maintainers keep clients up-to-date. The conclusion was that Sigstore Ruby needs another maintainer, and the group will work to identify a good candidate to assist with maintenance and development.

### Organizations

We finished up the remaining features for the Organizations beta.  Next up, we’ll onboard AWS as the first organization in production.  We’ll monitor how that goes and be ready to address any issues that come up.  The next phase of Organizations is to plan out the remaining features for a public launch and if there will be a paid tier.

### Security Working Group

No significant activity in June.  A few more people joined the group.  Marty is planning to continue with this in July.  Next steps are ironing out how the group will work.  The goal is to schedule our first meeting once that’s done.  

One observation so far: no one has engaged with the forum yet.  I have some concerns with this.  I suspect they are waiting for me to get things started.  At the least, I’ll have this be the home for supply chain security conversations, which RubyGems will drive.  If the other groups don’t use it beyond that, it’s fine.

### Rubygems.org Policies 

We pushed back going live with the new RubyGems.org policies on June 4th, like we had planned due to last-minute feedback we received.  An important clarification in the policy was around restricting the deletion policy in the case of actively used gems.  After some back and forth with legal counsel, the policies went live on June 30th. 

We have several follow-up actions for this.  First, we’ll post a blog post on Rubygems.org about the policies being live.  We have a backlog of customer support tickets due to the policies to work through, some requesting to delete their accounts.  Finally, the team will refine the specific policies around ownership transfer, absent accounts, and gem lifecycle (deprecation, yanking, deletion). 

### Baltic Ruby Keynote

Marty’s primary effort in June went into his [Baltic Ruby](https://balticruby.org/) [keynote](https://speakerdeck.com/mghaught/baltic-ruby-keynote-2025).  He traveled to Riga, Latvia to deliver the opening keynote on the second day, focusing on open source sustainability with RubyGems. The talk was well received and sparked a lot of discussion among attendees, particularly around the high uptime of RubyGems, the lack of awareness about who runs and funds it, and the potential impacts of an extended outage on the ecosystem.

Conversations after the talk revealed that many in the audience were unfamiliar with Ruby Central and its role, which highlighted a gap in visibility, especially in European communities. This has prompted him to consider how the organization might expand its international presence. Attendees also expressed surprise and concern over security topics like malicious gem scanning and the EU's Cyber Resilience Act, further affirming the importance of raising awareness and improving education around these issues.

Perhaps most notably, the idea of a business membership model resonated strongly with the audience. Several attendees expressed interest in financially supporting RubyGems, with one even saying they would have signed up on the spot if such an option existed. This feedback validated Marty’s thinking and raised the urgency of launching a sustainable funding program. He also heard from a couple of potential contributors, which reinforced the need for clearer pathways into contributing to RubyGems. Overall, the trip sparked valuable insights and opportunities to strengthen both visibility and support for the Ruby ecosystem.

He stayed another week in the UK to attend [Brighton Ruby](https://brightonruby.com/) and a [Ruby meetup](https://lu.ma/286b35qd) in London.  Marty connected with a few potential sponsors and had great conversations with attendees around sustainability in the Ruby open source ecosystem.  

### Open Source Summit North America

Just days after returning from Europe, Marty attended the Alpha-Omega meetings during Open Source Summit in Denver.  Being local, Marty was able to drive down for the day.  It was fantastic to meet several from Alpha-Omega and its working groups in person.  Outside of the two sessions, the chat during lunch and happy hour/dinner were gold. 

## Infrastructure Security - SSO

Colby developed the first draft of the step-by-step migration that forms Stage 1 of the RubyGems.org Single Sign-On proposal. He has been meeting with Eleanor Saitta, our security advisor, to understand AWS, Google Workspace & Single Sign On processes to ensure we are following best practices and making the right compromises without compromising overall security.

What’s Next?
* Finish developing the final version of the migration procedure. 
* Have the proposal reviewed and signed off by Eleanor Saitta.
* Develop a timeline for users to be migrated from their AWS IAM credentials to Single Sign On
* Have the rubygems.org team sign off on the timeline and migration proposal
* Kick-off stage 2

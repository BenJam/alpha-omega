### Gems with Prebuilt Binaries

Samuel [finished refactoring](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/8703) `Gem::Platform` matching logic that was in Bundler to live in RubyGems, in preparation for `wheel` support to hit both projects simultaneously. Samuel has already used this refactor to [improve platform](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/8751) selection in the RubyGems CLI, picking the best platform gem that matches the running platform. Overall, this work will enable sharing code for new platform matching between Bundler & RubyGems. Samuel spent the majority of the month prototyping ways to shove the new platform information for wheels into platform strings in a backwards-compatible way. As a part of this prototyping work, Samuel finished research on how to translate python’s platform tags to the ruby ecosystem. The conclusion is that rubygems won’t need a separate ABI tag from the Ruby tag, since ruby implementations tend not to have stable ABIs, unlike CPython. Expect a PR demonstrating wheels to hit in the coming month.

### Binary Transparency

Samuel continued discussions at OSS NA around creating a binary transparency scheme that will work across packaging repositories. This included developing a more comprehensive threat model that BT is meant to address, in addition to sketching out a deployment plan that will involve the different package registries witnessing each others BT logs.

### Sigstore Ruby

Samuel led a discussion at the Sigstore meetup at OSS NA around helping Sigstore client maintainers keep clients up-to-date. The conclusion was that Sigstore Ruby needs another maintainer, and the group will work to identify a good candidate to assist with maintenance and development.

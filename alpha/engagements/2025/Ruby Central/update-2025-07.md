### Organizations

AWS went live in production as the first Organization on RubyGems.org.  The team processed the initial feedback and addressed immediate concerns.  We’re currently thinking through how to help them transfer 400 gems into the organization.

### RailsConf & Team offsite

Our annual developer conference, RailsConf, happened in Philadelphia on July 8-10.  The RubyGems team had a table during the community day Hackspace.  We saw good engagement from attendees with 5 PRs submitted from new contributors.

Additionally, we held a team offsite the day after the conference with 6 team members in town and 3 connecting remotely.  It was good to see the team in person and we had some productive conversations (see next section).

### Rubygems.org Policies

A big topic of the team offsite was the specifics of policies on gem deletion, archiving, gem ownership and unreachable maintainers. We were largely in agreement and copious notes were taken.  We have a follow-up to draft these policies for internal review.

### Security Working Group

This has been on hold while Marty focused on other things.  Marty did invite the group to a Doodle to schedule our first meeting in mid-to-late August.  So far only 3 people have engaged so some reminders will need to go out.  

## Infrastructure Security - SSO

Colby completed the project plan document including the timeline.  It’s been reviewed and work on the first phase has started.  The bulk of the work will happen in August.  Legacy access will be removed in November.

### RFC: Better Binary Gem Support

Samuel wrote up an RFC for improving how RubyGems handles precompiled binary gems ([RFC #60](https://github.com/rubygems/rfcs/pull/60)). The current platform system is too coarse-grained — you end up with gems that claim to work on "x86_64-linux" but actually need specific libc versions or Ruby ABI details. The RFC proposes a new tagging format that lets gem authors be much more specific about what their binaries actually support.

The big win here is fewer "works on my machine" issues when installing binary gems, plus gem authors can ship more targeted binaries without worrying about compatibility across every possible Linux distro. Still hashing out the details with the RubyGems team, particularly around what the tooling story looks like for gem authors.

### Implementation Work

The actual implementation ([PR #8891](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/8891)) has been a beast. Samuel's been wrestling with the fundamental problem that `Gem::Platform` needs to serve two very different purposes — describing what platforms a gem supports vs. describing the concrete platform you're running on. These are _different things_ and jamming them into the same string format that every version of RubyGems expects to understand has been... challenging.

The solution involved borrowing the "wheel" concept from Python (tag sets representing platform compatibility) plus introducing specific platform descriptions for concrete machines. So now Samuel's `arm64-darwin-23` machine running Ruby 3.4.4 can generate a set of compatibility tags, and gems can ship with their own compatibility tag sets.

Most of the RubyGems side is working, but there's still a chunk of Bundler resolver work needed before this can ship. Plus the implementation will need some updates based on feedback from the RFC process — turns out getting the design right is just as tricky as the implementation.

### RubyConf Taiwan Talk

Samuel gave a talk at RubyConf Taiwan on "Funding Ruby Infrastructure as a Non-Profit", covering how Ruby Central keeps the lights on for rubygems.org and bundler development. Lots of good questions from the audience about sustainability models and what happens when key infrastructure depends on volunteer maintainers.

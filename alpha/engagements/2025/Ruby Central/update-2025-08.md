### RFC: Better Binary Gem Support

Samuel wrote up an RFC for improving how RubyGems handles precompiled binary gems ([RFC #60](https://github.com/rubygems/rfcs/pull/60)). The current platform system is too coarse-grained — you end up with gems that claim to work on "x86_64-linux" but actually need specific libc versions or Ruby ABI details. The RFC proposes a new tagging format that lets gem authors be much more specific about what their binaries actually support.

The big win here is fewer "works on my machine" issues when installing binary gems, plus gem authors can ship more targeted binaries without worrying about compatibility across every possible Linux distro. Still hashing out the details with the RubyGems team, particularly around what the tooling story looks like for gem authors.

### Implementation Work

The actual implementation ([PR #8891](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/8891)) has been a beast. Samuel's been wrestling with the fundamental problem that `Gem::Platform` needs to serve two very different purposes — describing what platforms a gem supports vs. describing the concrete platform you're running on. These are _different things_ and jamming them into the same string format that every version of RubyGems expects to understand has been... challenging.

The solution involved borrowing the "wheel" concept from Python (tag sets representing platform compatibility) plus introducing specific platform descriptions for concrete machines. So now Samuel's `arm64-darwin-23` machine running Ruby 3.4.4 can generate a set of compatibility tags, and gems can ship with their own compatibility tag sets.

Most of the RubyGems side is working, but there's still a chunk of Bundler resolver work needed before this can ship. Plus the implementation will need some updates based on feedback from the RFC process — turns out getting the design right is just as tricky as the implementation.

### RubyConf Taiwan Talk

Samuel gave a talk at RubyConf Taiwan on "Funding Ruby Infrastructure as a Non-Profit", covering how Ruby Central keeps the lights on for rubygems.org and bundler development. Lots of good questions from the audience about sustainability models and what happens when key infrastructure depends on volunteer maintainers.

### Organizations
We've been actively gathering feedback from AWS to help shape our implementation. Based on their feedback, we've made a significant improvement to the gem transfer feature - organizations can now transfer multiple gems in a single transfer operation, which is a big improvement over the previous one-by-one transfer process that was causing friction for organizations with a large gem catalog.  

Marty requested introductions to the SDK teams at Azure and Google.  We'd like to onboard them as organizations to garner their feedback.

We're at a good point to pause this work. The next phase is adding more enterprise grade features, such as teams. We also view this as our best source of sustainable revenue through paid tiers of organizations.  It will need to be funded to go further.

### Security Working Group

Marty facilitated the first security working group session on August 19th.  We had 12 in attendance, including members of the Rails Security team, Shopify, Gusto, Cisco, and GitHub.  The highlight of the meeting was interest from multiple parties in Bundle Audit and Bundle Policy.  We will plan to leverage this group to share our work on supply chain security and collect early feedback on adoption at scale. 

### Malicious Gems process

Marty wrote a [popular post](https://blog.rubygems.org/2025/08/25/rubygems-security-response.html) on how RubyGems deals with malicious packages.  It got traction in [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45016794), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/1mzvju0/rubygems_security_response_to_socketdev_how_we/), and [Ruby Weekly](https://rubyweekly.com/issues/764).  He received many positive comments privately.  This was one of our more visible posts and helps the community see how we're proactive with supply chain security.

### Funding Model and Supporters page

Stemming from feedback from Marty's keynote at Baltic Ruby, he wrote a blog post and rolled out a new supporter program.  [RubyGems.org Funding Model & A New Path For Community-Led Growth](https://rubycentral.org/news/rubygems-org-funding-model-a-new-path-for-community-led-growth/) was published on August 1st.  It highlighted for the community the funding model that RubyGems currently has and made the case for community-led funding.  Timed with this blog post, the [new supporter program](https://rubygems.org/pages/supporters) was launched.  We received 3 new supporters immediately.  With this program in place, there is now a clear path for companies to support RubyGems on a small but meaningful level.

Marty worked further to revamp the corporate sponsorship program, which has not yielded new sponsors.  We expect to roll out a dedicated open source sponsorship program in September.  It will take time to take hold but these efforts will allow RubyGems to have more predictable funding for operations and security work.

### Rails World

Marty will be presenting a lightning talk on the [EU's Cyber Resilience Act](https://openssf.org/public-policy/eu-cyber-resilience-act/) at the Rails World conference in Amsterdam.  This is the first piece in educating the Ruby community on the obligations of the CRA.  He also hopes to build interest in our efforts to provide tooling to ease the transition.

## Infrastructure Security - SSO

We've made significant progress on our Single Sign On implementation this month. We successfully deployed Google Workspace and AWS Identity Center to production, which included provisioning new rubygems.org email addresses for all developers on the team. As part of this rollout, we've also configured our SIEM logs to publish to Datadog, giving us better visibility into authentication events and potential security issues. To strengthen our overall security architecture, we bootstrapped a new dedicated security account under the RubyCentral AWS Organization. This new account now serves as our centralized hub for security services - we've delegated and configured GuardDuty for threat detection, AWS Config for compliance monitoring, Security Hub for security posture management, and Access Manager for fine-grained access controls.

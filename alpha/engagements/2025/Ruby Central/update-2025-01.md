### 2025 Roadmap and Fundraising
Marty shared the 2025 budget and roadmap with the OSS team and Ruby Central’s Board of Directors. It received positive reviews and awaits final approval from the board, which is expected in February.  The other important news is that we finalized our new positioning for our sponsorship prospectus, which was blocking our fundraising efforts. This will also be incorporated into our first annual report.  

### Policy Work
Marty worked with Aaron Williamson to draft the initial versions of an Acceptable Use and Terms of Service.  These have received a positive review by the team leaving our deletion (yank) policies as the last section to resolve before producing the final version.  We anticipate that this will be finalized and published in mid-February.

### Organizations
Marty reviewed what’s outstanding with the Organizations feature before starting beta testing in production.  We have allocated budget for the work to proceed in February.  Once that is complete we’ll give the AWS team a preview of the flows for their feedback.

### Infrastructure Controls
One of our big initiatives for 2025 came out of last year’s security audit.  We’re looking to improve the access and controls around our infrastructure.  We spent some time planning out how to proceed.  We are actively working with two experts in the space around a holistic proposal.  While we’re making progress, we suspect it will take several weeks to get to a final proposal.  

The team discussed starting a small scope of the work while we finish the holistic proposal.  Marty will write up a proposal covering the goals of the full proposal while only defining a small initial phase around SSO access to AWS. This will allow us to start on an impactful part of the work while allowing more time to complete the rest of the proposal.

## Project progress

While December 2024 marks the last installment of the agreed funding for the project for now, we accumulated
enough of the funds to carry the project and spend money on further steps as well as continue speaking about
the project at conferences. Most of the feedback and contributions to Airflow dependencies seem to require
just engineering effort of the Airflow team not monetary rewards, so spending the money on speaking and
travelling  and increasing awareness of the project progress seems like a good idea.

There are enough funds to continue the project for the next 6 months in that mode at which point we might
revisit the need for further funding.

We gave a talk at FOSDEM at SBOM track about the progress of the project. The talk was well received.

The tooling team members for the ASF have started their work and are getting familiar with the neeeds of
ASF, Jarek takes active role in onboarding and discussing details of the work.

We are still waiting for the ASF side of .asf.yaml configuration to be completed to deploy
Trusted Publishing workflow that will be reusable for the Apache Software
Foundation projects. PR is still [in progress](https://github.com/gopidesupavan/gh-svn-pypi-publisher/pull/1)

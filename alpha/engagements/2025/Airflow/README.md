The goal of the project is to perform “Supply chain Analysis” of Apache Airflow and perform actions
that aim to improve overall supply chain security for Airflow. Airflow has 700+ Python dependencies,
many of which are important part of the “Data processing” Python ecosystem and through Apache Airflow
being the “user” and “depending” on those, it’s possible to efficiently improve awareness of the need of
security improvement and to help Airflow dependencies to improve the security posture and processes.

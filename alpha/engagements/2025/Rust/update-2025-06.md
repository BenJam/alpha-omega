There has been substantial progress on Trusted Publishing - frontend and backend nearly complete. A new effort on vulnerability surfacing being spun up, thanks to Alpha-Omega support. Also the FLS has been published within the Rust Project processes and removing external dependencies.

## Trusted Publishing

June 2025 delivered the core Trusted Publishing functionality for crates.io. Tobias completed the main publishing pipeline in https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/11294, which adjusted the existing publish endpoint to accept short-lived API tokens received from the token exchange process.

Tobias implemented the user interface in https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/11398, adding a "Trusted Publishing" section to crate settings where users can configure and manage GitHub Actions workflows as trusted publishers. He also added comprehensive documentation in https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/11414 with setup instructions and workflow examples.

Security enhancements include GitHub Secret Scanning integration (https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/11405) for automatic detection of exposed tokens and an incident response system (https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/11419) that sends email notifications and enables token revocation when compromises are detected.

Marco is concurrently developing the GitHub Action implementation, which provides the client-side tooling that will allow Rust projects to seamlessly adopt Trusted Publishing in their CI/CD workflows. This work is nearing completion and will be the final piece needed for ecosystem-wide adoption.

## Capslock

We are continuing the process of determining a tactical engineering plan and what resources would be necessary to implement that plan.

## Vulnerability Surfacing

Thank you to the support of Alpha-Omega, we are going to begin work on surfacing crate vulnerabilities in crates.io. The great news is that this work already has Rust community interest.

On a technical level, this work requires:

Ingesting [RustSec](https://rustsec.org/) advisories into crates.io.
Designing and implementing new UI patterns to surface the advisories.

The latter is expected to take up the most time here, as an RFC will likely be required to gather feedback and surface concerns from peer Rust teams such as Cargo and the Security Response team.

We are in the resource planning stage and plan to begin within a couple of months.

## Other Engineering

### TUF Implementation

On the heels of the multiple TUF implementations [announced](https://github.com/ossf/alpha-omega/blob/main/alpha/engagements/2025/Rust/update-2025-05.md#tuf-implementation-update) last month, discussions with interested parties in the Rust Project are set for the coming weeks to discuss the pros and cons of each implementation. The hope is to try to converge on an implementation that most folks agree is the right direction.

### Painter as a Standalone Library

Near completion of the effort to move Painter to a standalone library. Recall, the analysis engine and LLVM integrations of painter are being broken off into a separate library crate, allowing for it to be leveraged by further analysis tooling, particularly for our Capslock/cargo-cgsec work (as it emits Capslock call graphs), and also for the general public.

## Announcements and Community

### FLS now being published inside the Rust Project

The [FLS](https://github.com/rust-lang/fls) (formerly the Ferrocene Language Specification) is now being published within the Rust Project, having removed all dependencies from Ferrocene. This is a big milestone as the Project now begins to consider the future of the FLS as it relates to the Rust specification effort.

### Open Source Summit North America

Some members of the Rust Foundation attended the Open Source Summit North America conference in Denver. This included various discussions and roundtables with members of Alpha-Omega and attending OpenSSF Day.

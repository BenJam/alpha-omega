August was a lighter month than normal given a bunch of people away for various conferences and PTO. Work this month included removing inactive members from Rust Project GitHub repositories, forward progress finding engineering resources for vulnerability surfacing and publishing the Technology Team report.

## Trusted Publishing

Initial implementation [live and in production](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/07/11/crates-io-development-update-2025-07/).

## Capslock

No relevant updates.

## Vulnerability Surfacing

Walter and Joel met with a potential engineering candidate to do this work. We are in discussions to determine whether it will be practical and feasible to move forward.

## Other Engineering

### Removing Inactive Members from Rust Project GitHub Organizations

The Rust Project Infra Team, which includes Foundation engineers Marco and JD, cleaned up all GitHub organizations managed by the Rust Project by removing members who are not part of any team within those organizations.

Members of the infra team worked on the implementation of the pull request and wrote the communication to send to members that were removed from the organizations.

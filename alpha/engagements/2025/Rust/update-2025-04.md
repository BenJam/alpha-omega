Work has begun in earnest on Trusted Publishing for crates.io. We will have a dedicated section in these reports for that work, along with work around Capslock.

## Trusted Publishing

Thank you to the support of Alpha-Omega, we have begun the Trusted Publishing implementation for crates.io. A trusted publishing for crates.io [RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3691), authored partly by William Woodruff at Trail of Bits, has been accepted by the Rust Project for implementation. [Trusted publishing](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/05/23/trusted-publishing-a-new-benchmark-for-packaging-security/) is used to strengthen the security posture around the supply chain of publishing Rust crates by reducing the risk of credential leaks and streamlining release workflows. The crates.io implementation of trusted publishing would utilize principles from the already existing [PyPI implementation](https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2023-04-20-introducing-trusted-publishers/) and align with the [OpenSSFâ€™s principles for package repository security](https://repos.openssf.org/principles-for-package-repository-security#authorization).

Tobias has already begun work on the implementation. He is focusing on the meta [architectural design](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/11056) and has also [submitted a pull request on the database layout](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/11062) required for the implementation.

You can track a bit of the work [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/10247).

## Capslock

Again, thank you to the support of Alpha-Omega, we are now beginning to flesh out a Rust-focused implementation of [Capslock](https://github.com/google/capslock).

Walter and Adam have created an implementation plan for an experimental [Cargo subcommand](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/external-tools.html#custom-subcommands) that analyses a Rust target and emits call graph data in the language-independent Capslock ingestion format

## Other Engineering

### TUF Implementation Update


### Infrastructure Security

Marco, along with other members of the Rust Project infrastructure team, [added](https://github.com/rust-lang/team/pull/1463) the [`rust-lang/rust` repository](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) to the [team repository](https://github.com/rust-lang/team), so that its settings are managed with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) rather than manually. This improves both the security and the maintainability of the repository. The `rust-lang/rust` repository was the last one missing: now all `rust-lang` repositories are managed with our IaC system.

### BorrowSanitizer

[BorrowSanitizer](https://borrowsanitizer.com/) is a dynamic analysis tool for detecting Rust-specific aliasing bugs in multi-language applications. Jon is exploring its potential usage in the C++/Rust interop initiative.

## Announcements and Community

### Alpha-Omega Working Group participation

Walter and Adam are actively participating in various Alpha-Omega working groups, including Capslock, securing software repos and more.

### Rust Week

Many members of the Rust Foundation, including those working on Alpha-Omega related security initiatives, will be at [Rust Week](https://rustweek.org/) in mid-May. There will be formal and informal discussions on many aspects of security, including TUF, Capslock, safety critical Rust, and C++/Rust Interop, with both members of the Rust community and others.

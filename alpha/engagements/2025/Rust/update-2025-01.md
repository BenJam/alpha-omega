Painter is on the verge of a big update while improvement to our crates scanning infrastructure and crates.io continued. Also, a notable increase in CI efficiency in just over 3 months of work.

## Engineering

### Painter Update

Walter is about to publicly land some major code changes to [Painter](https://github.com/rustfoundation/painter). Customized LLVM-based analysis, including scaffolding for importing LLVM IR into the graph database. Improved cross-crate analysis with import filters and de-duplication of functions. Behavioral analysis improvements with queries for function-name patterns, call path tracing and reverse lookups. Multi-path resolution for multi-version/feature crates. And, of course, improved documentation.

This update has a plan to be released within the next week.

### Crate Scanning Infrastructure

Adam has made progress on our crate scanning infrastructure. He released the [mapstic crates](https://github.com/LawnGnome/mapstic) for generating Elasticsearch mappings from Rust type definitions, since nothing existed already.

### Crates.io frontend changes

The crates.io team noticed that the `ember-cli-mirage` package they were depending on for the frontend test suite was no longer getting maintained properly, which led to it blocking other dependency updates. Tobias investigated alternatives and worked on a prototype based on the more popular and well maintained `msw` package. After some promising results, Tobias migrated the whole frontend codebase to a new internal `@crates-io/msw` package, based on `msw` and `@mswjs/data`.

### CI Efficiency

Marco has reduced the monetary cost of the Rust Project's CI by about 66%. These improvements came through technical optimizations, including build reordering, replacing large GitHub runners with free GitHub runners, all while maintaining minimal impact on Rust maintainers and community workflows.

## Announcements and Community

### Safety Critical Consortium

The [Rust Safety Critical Consortium](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium/) continues to make progress with its two primary subcommittees - [coding guidelines](http://subcommittee/coding-guidelines/README.md) and [tooling](http://subcommittee/tooling/README.md). The second full meeting of the Safety Critical Rust Consortium is scheduled for 19 February 2025 in London, coinciding with [Rust Nation](https://www.rustnationuk.com/). 

### Axum Maintainer

Tobias joins the Tokio project, axum, as an official maintainer. Axum is a 20K star GitHub Project that provides a web application framework built with Tokio, Hyper and Tower.

### PyCascades Portland

Adam is giving his [Quantifying Nebraska](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HQOTIqP6KM) talk at PyCascades in Portland.

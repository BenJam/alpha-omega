"Maintain-a-thon" titled "Security for the Long-Haul". The [description,
questions, and notes for that session are published online](https://sethmlarson.dev/un-open-source-week-2025-security-for-the-long-haul).

Seth attended Open Source Summit from June 23rd-25th. Seth gave a talk
"Phantom Dependencies: Is your requirements.txt haunted?" about his work
on Software Bill-of-Materials documents for Python packages. At Open
Source Summit Seth was a guest on the "What's in the SOSS?"
podcast. Seth attended the entire day of OSCSE and Alpha-Omega roundtable
discussions on Tuesday.

Seth also attended OpenSSF Community Day on June 26th where he delivered the opening
keynote "Security work isn't Special" which discussed how security work
for open source projects was unlike any other open source contribution
(features, bugfixes, docs, community, governance, etc) in that
not *anyone* in the community can do the work and the implications.
Seth was also a participant in the OpenSSF Community Day Tabletop Session (TTX)
playing the role of "Researcher".

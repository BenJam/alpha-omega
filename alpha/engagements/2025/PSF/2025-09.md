## PyPI Safety & Security Engineer (Mike Fiedler)

### Malware Response

During September, Mike processed 112 malware reports across the month.
Response times remained strong despite increased complexity and travel obligations,
with the majority of reports handled within 24 hours.
The automated quarantine system continues to demonstrate reliability
of the trust-based reporter mechanism with no false positives.

Mike addressed multiple sophisticated phishing campaigns targeting PyPI users.
On September 23rd, Mike responded to a reverse-proxy phishing attack using `pypi-mirror.org`,
which attempted to capture user credentials through a man-in-the-middle attack similar to the July incident.
Mike coordinated rapid response including reporting to Google Safe Browsing and Cloudflare,
identifying compromised user accounts, and implementing protective measures.
One attempt to enhance proxy protections was deployed and subsequently reverted
as it was ineffective against the threat model.

Mike also contributed to the response of a GitHub-based spam campaign
where attackers created malicious issues tagged with fake announcements
to exploit GitHub's email notification system.
Mike escalated domains to Google Safe Browsing
and engaged with the broader GitHub community to track the campaign's scope.

### Security Infrastructure & Authentication

Mike made significant progress on authentication security measures aligned with
[OpenSSF Principles for Package Repository Security](https://repos.openssf.org/principles-for-package-repository-security):

* Implemented [2FA brute force rate limiting](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18584) to prevent slow-roll authentication attacks, adding specific rate limits for TOTP, WebAuthn, and recovery code verification attempts
* Fixed [organization rename permission inconsistencies](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18626) for support operations
* Improved [post-login redirect behavior](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18545) to return users to their intended destination
* Set explicit [tab indexes for login forms](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18716) to improve accessibility

### Admin UI & Operational Improvements

Mike enhanced PyPI's administrative tooling to improve response efficiency:

* Added [Trusted Publisher details display](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18775) in admin views for better context during investigations
* Fixed [malware report CSS rendering issues](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18723) and [KeyError handling](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18725)
* Implemented [robots.txt discouragement](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18750) for account pages to reduce bot traffic
* Addressed [template view routing restrictions](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18572) to ensure proper domain enforcement

### Security Research & Analysis

Mike conducted comprehensive security analysis work:

* Completed a self-audit against [OpenSSF Principles for Package Repository Security](https://repos.openssf.org/principles-for-package-repository-security.html), identifying gaps and improvement opportunities
* Investigated suspicious packages and coordinated with maintainers to address potential threats
* Responded to GhostAction campaign targeting GitHub Actions workflows, exfiltrating PyPI API Tokens
* Published [blog post warning about GhostAction GitHub Actions attack campaign](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18705)
* Added [CodeQL scanning for GitHub Actions](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18704) to warehouse repository

### Community Engagement & Education

Mike participated in security community activities:

* Attended GitHub's Open Source Security Intensive webinar series (September 8-25), covering topics including threat modeling, CodeQL, UX security, and fuzzing
* Participated in OpenSSF Securing Software Repositories Working Group meeting, presenting PyPI's self-audit results
* Engaged in Q3 Alpha-Omega Roundtable discussions on sustainability and joint statements on stewardship
* Spoke with AWS Python SDK team to provide detailed feedback on their roadmap
* Started discussion on malware reporting workflows with GitHub Advisory Database Curation team
* Presented to a CTO roundtable on PyPI & supply chain security

Mike plans to attend GitHub Universe conference in October.

### Development & Maintenance

Mike contributed to PyPI infrastructure quality:

* Resolved [deprecation warnings in test suite](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18707)
* [Unpinned coverage testing tool](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18759) after previous performance issues resolved
* Upgraded multiple Dependabot updates for routine maintenance
* Investigated Management API token authentication approaches, researching HMAC-based signing mechanisms

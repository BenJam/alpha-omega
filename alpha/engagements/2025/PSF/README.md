# Python Software Foundation (PSF)

The Python Software Foundation has two full-time security
staff funded by Alpha-Omega:

* Seth Larson (Security Developer-in-Residence)
* Mike Fiedler (PyPI Safety and Security Engineer)

Mike focuses on the security of the Python Package Index (PyPI),
specifically PyPI's backend "Warehouse", malware reporting,
abuse limits, and operations.

Seth focuses on security of the Python language runtime CPython,
the standard library, and packaging standards and tools (ie "pip" and PEPs).

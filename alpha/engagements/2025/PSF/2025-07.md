# Update 2025-06

## Security Developer-in-Residence (Seth Larson)

Majority of Seth's time in July was spent triaging, testing, and developing patches for PSRT vulnerability reports.

### Open Source Security work isn't 'Special'

* Published blog post with the content of the OpenSSF Community Day NA keynote
  of the same title: <https://sethmlarson.dev/security-work-isnt-special>
* Attended the OpenSSF Vulnerability Disclosures WG to discuss this topic.
  The WG may develop a "concise guide" about how to balance security
  and sustainability, especially for smaller projects.

### Other items

* Completed, edited, and submitted Alpha-Omega case study (SBOMs for Python packages).
  The case study is ready to be published to the Python Software Foundation blog once publicized by Alpha-Omega.
* Published CVE-2025-8194 for a vulnerability in CPython "tarfile" module.
  * Patched PyPI once the vulnerability report was made public: <https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18428>
  * Backported to all Python versions.
* Published new version of Truststore to support Fedora's new certificate store location.
* Met with the newly announced Python Release Manager "Savannah Bailey". Will prepare
  her expected Sigstore OIDC identity once she's allocated an `@python.org` email address.
  Added her to the Python Security Response Team and mailing list.
* Small amount of follow-up work around NSF grant proposal.

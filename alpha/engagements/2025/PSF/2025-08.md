## PyPI Safety & Security Engineer (Mike Fiedler)

### Malware Response

During August, PyPI received over 200 inbound malware reports. The automated quarantine system continued to function without false positives, demonstrating its utility and improving trust in the reporters.

Mike enhanced PyPI Admin capabilities by implementing a ["quarantine all for user" feature](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18479) and adding an [admin page for quarantine management](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18495), streamlining the response process when dealing with accounts creating multiple malicious packages.

### Account Safety & Domain Resurrection Prevention

Building on July's work, Mike completed significant improvements to prevent domain resurrection attacks.
The system disabled approximately 2,000 accounts with expired email domains,
continuing the cleanup effort from previous months.

Mike published a comprehensive [blog post on domain resurrection prevention](https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2025-08-18-preventing-domain-resurrections/),
explaining PyPI's approach to this security threat.
This garnered interest on social/news sites, with roughly 5,000 pageviews since publication.
The implementation now prevents password resets for accounts with unverified email addresses from expired domains,
closing a potential account takeover vector.

Additionally, Mike implemented an [admin sent email lookup feature](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18500) to better track email delivery issues,
and authored specifications for [email suppression list management](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/issues/18501) for future admin use.

### Security Infrastructure Improvements

Mike worked with the team to address several security concerns:

- Collaborated with Seth Larson to deliver a [ZIP confusion attack prevention PR](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18492)
- Reviewed and assisted with the tarfile vulnerability fix ([CVE-2025-8194](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18428))
- Proposed a [2FA brute force limiter](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18584) to prevent authentication slow-roll attacks, per the Authentication section of [OpenSSF Principles for Package Repository Security](https://repos.openssf.org/principles-for-package-repository-security)
- Authored [data validation improvement for Admin views](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/issues/18511)
- Triaged & closed [old issue on use of md5 checksums](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/issues/14717#issuecomment-3211406465)

Mike also began a conversation on potential integration with VirusTotal,
discussing use of their CodeInsights feature for automated malware detection.

## Security Developer-in-Residence (Seth Larson)

- White paper on "Unmasking Phantom Dependencies: Software Bill-of-Materails for Python packages"
  was published to [Alpha-Omega](https://alpha-omega.dev/blog/unmasking-phantom-dependencies-with-software-bill-of-materials-as-ecosystem-neutral-metadata-white-paper-by-seth-larson-python-software-foundation/) and the [Python Software Foundation](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/08/unmasking-phantom-dependencies-with.html) blogs.
- Published coordinated advisory for uv and [Python Package Index rejecting ZIP archives](https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2025-08-07-wheel-archive-confusion-attacks/)
  that could abuse ZIP implementation differentials.
- Published "[The vulnerability might be in the proof-of-concept](https://sethmlarson.dev/the-vulnerability-is-in-the-proof-of-concept)"
  blog post informing open source security teams about a common approach
  that reporters use to convince teams that there's a vulnerability in a project:
  by submitting insecure code in the proof-of-concept.
- [Responded with Steve Dower](https://discuss.python.org/t/windows-code-signing-certificates-for-python-3-12-8-3-13-1-revoked/103356/2) to reports that Python Software Foundation
  certificates had been used to sign malware. Audited release process for Windows
  but turns out the reports were not correct, the malware was signed but the signatures
  weren't correct, therefore the certificates were not leaked.
- Met with GitHub Security product team to discuss GitHub Security Advisories.
- Support for [Software Bill-of-Materials](https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel/pull/577) (PEP 770) generation has finally been merged into
  auditwheel. Once released, this will mean many projects will begin generating SBOM documents
  automatically without further updates.
- Documented existing security-related practices and open standards that CPython implements as a part of
  submission for the [Digital Public Goods](https://www.digitalpublicgoods.net/registry) registry.
- Published [Truststore v0.10.4](https://github.com/sethmlarson/truststore/releases/tag/v0.10.4) which fixed a thread-safety issue when configuring a shared `SSLContext`.
  Updated pip and PDM.
- Handled reports to the Python Security Response Team.

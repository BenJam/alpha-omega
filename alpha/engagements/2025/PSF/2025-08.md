## PyPI Safety & Security Engineer (Mike Fiedler)

### Malware Response

During August, PyPI received over 200 inbound malware reports. The automated quarantine system continued to function without false positives, demonstrating its utility and improving trust in the reporters.

Mike enhanced PyPI Admin capabilities by implementing a ["quarantine all for user" feature](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18479) and adding an [admin page for quarantine management](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18495), streamlining the response process when dealing with accounts creating multiple malicious packages.

### Account Safety & Domain Resurrection Prevention

Building on July's work, Mike completed significant improvements to prevent domain resurrection attacks.
The system disabled approximately 2,000 accounts with expired email domains,
continuing the cleanup effort from previous months.

Mike published a comprehensive [blog post on domain resurrection prevention](https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2025-08-18-preventing-domain-resurrections/),
explaining PyPI's approach to this security threat.
This garnered interest on social/news sites, with roughly 5,000 pageviews since publication.
The implementation now prevents password resets for accounts with unverified email addresses from expired domains,
closing a potential account takeover vector.

Additionally, Mike implemented an [admin sent email lookup feature](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18500) to better track email delivery issues,
and authored specifications for [email suppression list management](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/issues/18501) for future admin use.

### Security Infrastructure Improvements

Mike worked with the team to address several security concerns:

- Collaborated with Seth Larson to deliver a [ZIP confusion attack prevention PR](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18492)
- Reviewed and assisted with the tarfile vulnerability fix ([CVE-2025-8194](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18428))
- Proposed a [2FA brute force limiter](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18584) to prevent authentication slow-roll attacks, per the Authentication section of [OpenSSF Principles for Package Repository Security](https://repos.openssf.org/principles-for-package-repository-security)
- Authored [data validation improvement for Admin views](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/issues/18511)
- Triaged & closed [old issue on use of md5 checksums](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/issues/14717#issuecomment-3211406465)

Mike also began a conversation on potential integration with VirusTotal,
discussing use of their CodeInsights feature for automated malware detection.

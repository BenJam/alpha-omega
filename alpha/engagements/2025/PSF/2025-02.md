# Update 2025-02

## PyPI Safety & Security Engineer (Mike Fiedler)

### Malware Response

In February, Mike handled 93 malware reports, which required further analysis
to distinguish between false positives and actual threats.
Five advisories were issued, with the most notable being `automslc`
[PYSEC-2025-4](https://osv.dev/vulnerability/PYSEC-2025-4),
reported by an external security researcher.

The [Project Quarantine](https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2024-12-30-quarantine/)
feature, previously mentioned, continues to be effective in containing threats.
Mike has developed an extension to automate the process further,
reducing malware time-on-index and improving PyPI Admin response times.
Now, if two or more qualified malware reports are received for a project,
the project is automatically quarantined,
and PyPI Admins are notified in real-time for further action.

Automated quarantine has fired 14 times in February,
often within a few hours of malicious projects being uploaded.

### Typosquatting Prevention

Mike has been collecting prior efforts on typo-squatting prevention
from both PyPI and other ecosystems.
In February, he drafted a new feature to combat typo-squatting, based on
[prior work from the Crates.io team](https://github.com/rustfoundation/typomania),
which itself is based on [typoguard](https://github.com/mt3443/typogard)
[(aka SpellBound) paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03471),
which was written in Python, to measure the JavaScript `npm` ecosystem.
The feature is currently [in review](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/17649)
prior to further testing and refinement.

### Community Engagement

With funding from [AWS Open Source](https://aws.amazon.com/opensource/),
Mike attended [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2025/) in Brussels,
followed by [State of Open Con 25](https://stateofopencon.com/) in London.
At these conferences, he attended talks on security and open source,
and met with other folks in the open source security and governance space.

Mike spoke at an [AWS Community Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/)
sharing session on his path to the PSF and PyPI,
what working on foundational open source security is like,
and how folks can get involved.

Mike also spoke to the [BUGS @ NYU open source club](https://bugsnyu.com/)
about his work at the PSF and how they can get involved.

### Other Items

- Reviewed code and content for updates to PyPI Terms of Service and new notification and recording mechanism
- Added more type hints to warehouse codebase, to further safety during development
- Performed various maintenance tasks and code reviews

## Security Developer-in-Residence (Seth Larson)

### SBOMs for Python packages (PEP 770)

[PEP 770 is in the final review stages](https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-770-improving-measurability-of-python-packages-with-software-bill-of-materials/76308)
before the standard is marked as **Provisional** and build backends and other tools can begin implementation.
The final decision on how to include static SBOM files into Python package archives is all that's remaining before the PEP delegate
Brett Cannon can announce provisional status.

In preparation for provisional status, Seth began implementing the logic for projects which will need to adopt the standard
as soon as possible to avoid delaying adoption by other projects (namely, PyPI, publishing tools, build backends).
In addition to this, Seth developed a small new project "[whichprovides](https://pypi.org/project/whichprovides)" which abstracts the ability to map a file
to a software identity (usually a PURL) for common package managers on Linux. This will benefit tools like auditwheel
which can automatically annotate Python packages built using third-party libraries with this logic.

Seth's talk at PyCon US 2025 was accepted on this topic, the title of the talk is "Phantom Dependencies: is your requirements.txt haunted?"
and will cover the phantom dependency problem, SBOMs, vulnerability scanners and how the new standard mitigates the phantom dependency problem.
The talk will also cover the experience with engaging in the Python packaging standards, lessons learned, and future work.

### PyCon US 2025 Supply-Chain Security Mini-Track

Seth is co-organizing a "Supply-Chain Security" mini-track colocated at PyCon US which will feature short talks with time for discussion
about supply-chain security topics. In addition to co-organizing, Seth will be giving a quick update about the Cyber Resilience Act and answering
questions as a part of the mini-track. More details will be published (date and time) once the final PyCon US talk schedule is published at the
end of the month.

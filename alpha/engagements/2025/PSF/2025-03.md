### SBOMs for Python packages

After more discussion and hang-ups over the method for statically
defining source SBOMs (due to issues discovered in PEP 639, the PEP that
this mechanism was inspired by) Seth refactored this part of PEP 770
out so that the rest can proceed. The PEP is currently waiting for
provisional acceptance so other pull requests can be merged into packaging projects.

The mechanism for specifying SBOM documents by build backends and tools
is still in PEP 770, and it's likely that this mechanism will be more widespread
as it's tools doing the SBOM generation rather than maintainers manually generating
the documents.

Seth created the [`whichprovides` project](https://pypi.org/project/whichprovides) which supports the common Linux distros
(Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, RockyLinux, AlmaLinux, Alpine) that `manylinx` and `musllinux` wheels are built using.
This project will be adopted by auditwheel as soon as PEP 770 is accepted into
provisional status so SBOMs can begin automatically being generated for bundled libraries.

Seth [created a pull request](https://github.com/pradyunsg/vendoring/pull/66) adding SBOM document generation support to `vendoring`,
the tool that pip and other packaging tools use to bundle libraries from PyPI and patch
them to work as local modules.

Seth has begun developing the presentation for his PyCon US 2025 talk on this
subject and the case study for Alpha-Omega Q1.

### NSF Safe-OSE proposal preparation

The Python Software Foundation was invited to submit a full proposal
after our preliminary proposal to the NSF Safe-OSE solicitation was
accepted. Seth and Loren have been working on preparing a full proposal
to submit related to automated malware remediation on PyPI and capability
and behavior analysis of Python software.

### Other items

* Seth answered questions from the Python Steering Council about
  core developer access.
* Upgraded libexpat to 2.7.0 to fix CVE-2024-8176.
* Participated in both Alpha-Omega meetings for March.

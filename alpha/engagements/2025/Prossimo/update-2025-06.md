# Rust for Linux

Please find below our June 2025 update for Internet Security Research Group (ISRG)’s Prossimo “Rust for Linux” project.

**About the project:**

Our goal for the [Rust for Linux](https://rust-for-linux.com/) project is to add support for the memory safe Rust language to the Linux kernel, in order to improve the security and reliability of billions of devices and computer systems that use the Linux kernel around the world. Rust was merged into the open source Linux kernel in late 2022, which was a key milestone towards that goal. Thanks to support from Alpha-Omega, ISRG is working with the primary maintainer of Rust for Linux, Miguel Ojeda, to continue to improve the support for Rust in the Linux kernel so that the first major Rust production drivers can be merged upstream.

**June 2025 Highlights:**

The regular Rust PR for the Linux v6.16 kernel cycle landed in mainline [1]. In addition, the first Rust fixes PR for v6.16 was prepared, sent and merged [2]. A second Rust fixes PR is being prepared. The first patches for the future v6.17 PR have been applied. The regular Rust PRs sent each kernel cycle (as well as the “fixes” PRs), represent the combined work from a multitude of developers and several major companies that adds and maintains the required features (such as Rust abstractions for kernel C APIs) that the first major Rust production drivers need.

LWN published the first part of a Rust for Linux series, which was reviewed [3]. Kangrejos 2025 [4] is being prepared and the invitations were sent. For LPC 2025 [5], the Rust Microconference proposal was submitted -- if accepted, it will be the fourth year in a row. Rust for Linux being part of the 2025H2 Rust project goals again is also being discussed [6] and the latest updates for 2025H1 were published [7]. Technical work in related projects such as upstream Rust, Clippy and tc-build continued. The Rust for Linux talk from RustWeek is now available [8].

The set above is a mix of different updates around kernel-related projects and events outside the kernel proper. Keeping the relationships and the visibility of the project as well as pushing forward certain technical work around them is important to continue growing the community and the support from other projects, companies and other entities. This, in turn, allows Rust for Linux to keep scaling up in order to match the work needed to support the different kinds of drivers getting upstreamed.


**June 2025 Additional Work Undertaken:**

Beyond what is highlighted above, we continued work toward the below, all aimed at improving the support for Rust in the Linux kernel so that the first major Rust production drivers can be merged upstream.

We continued maintenance of the development branch by applying/reviewing/testing patches, solving conflicts with other subsystems, reproducing issues, and maintaining the CIs. 

As part of our work maintaining Rust support in the stable kernels, we backported Rust fixes when required and tested the branches with Rust enabled.

We performed other subsystem maintenance, including reporting issues to other projects and maintaining the ["live lists"](https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/linux/issues/2), which track bugfixes, wanted features, and unstable features from other projects.

We furthered technical development of Rust in the Linux kernel via continued development of the new build system.

We performed Rust for Linux core team management via maintenance of the internal spreadsheets of the team (that track the status of all patch series, PRs, versioning, etc.), organizing and leading the core team weekly meetings, and keeping track of news relevant for the team.

We supported building the Rust Community by writing new content and guiding new contributors.
